Artificial intelligence is beginning to help doctors screen patients for several routine diseases. But a new study raises concerns about whether doctors might become too reliant on AI.

The study looking at gastroenterologists in Poland found that they appeared to be about 20% worse at spotting polyps and other abnormalities during colonoscopies on their own, after they'd grown accustomed to using an AI-assisted system.

The findings, published in the journal Lancet Gastroenterology and Hepatology, suggest that even after a short period of using AI, experts may become overly dependent on AI to do certain aspects of their jobs.

""We were quite surprised,"" says Marcin Romańczyk, an M.D.-Ph.D. gastroenterologist at H-T Medical Center in Tychy, Poland, who led the study.

But not everyone is convinced that the paper proves doctors are losing critical skills because of AI.

""I think three months seems like a very short period to lose a skill that you took 26 years to build up,"" says Johan Hulleman, a researcher at Manchester University in England who has studied human reliance on artificial intelligence.

Hulleman believes statistical variations in the patient data might be part of the explanation for why the numbers appear to drop. Factors such as the average age of the patients used in different sections of the study might explain the variation, he says.

AI in medicine

Artificial intelligence is becoming increasingly common for a number of routine medical scans. The next time you get a scan for your eyes, breast cancer, or colon disease, there's a decent chance that AI might be analyzing the images.

""AI is spreading everywhere,"" Romańczyk says. At the same time, many doctors are playing catch-up, because learning how to use the technology wasn't part of their training.

""We've been taught from books and from our teachers,"" he says. ""No one told us how to use AI.""

A few years ago, four clinics in Poland tried out an AI system to detect polyps and other abnormalities during colonoscopies. The AI works in real time, analyzing video from a camera inside the colon.

If it spots something, it will highlight the area for the clinician to see.

""In this particular one there's a green box, showing where the polyp might be,"" he says.

In the box

The clinics were collecting data on whether the AI system worked. It turns out it did, but when Romańczyk and his colleagues reanalyzed the data, they found something else: After the system was introduced, doctors became significantly worse at detecting possible polyps when the AI was switched off.

According to their analysis, after doctors got AI, detection rates of possible polyps fell from 28.4% to 22.4% when their new AI system was switched off. In other words, the doctors seemed to become quickly dependent on AI systems catching the polyps. Romańczyk says he's not quite sure why it's happening, but he has some theories.

""We are subconsciously waiting for the green box to come out to show us the region where the polyp is and we're not paying so much attention,"" he says.

There are other examples that support that idea: A similar study has shown that nonexperts do a worse job scanning mammograms if they know they can get an AI system to help them with the push of a button.

Johan Hulleman, who helped lead that mammogram study, describes it as a ""safety-net effect."" He says these latest results could be interesting, but he's skeptical. The study of colonoscopies took place over three months, and the doctors participating had decades of experience. He thinks statistical variations due to a number of factors, such as age of the patients, might be behind the apparent drop.

Additionally, he says, ""We don't know how many polyps there really were, so we don't know the ground truth."" By that he means it's unclear how many of the possible polyps that doctors supposedly missed were actually medically important.

The study's author, Romańczyk, does believe the drop is real — though he admits that studying AI in a clinical setting like this can be tricky. There are a lot of variables the researchers couldn't control.

He's not against using AI. He actually thinks the little green boxes help him to do better colonoscopies. But he thinks that there should be more studies like these examining how AI might be changing the way doctors work in the real world.

""Because look what's happening,"" he says. ""We have AI systems that are available, but we don't have the data.""","Sentiment score -0.20000000298023224 , Sentiment Magnitude 14.399999618530273","name:Johan Hulleman type: 1 Salience 0.08394350111484528, name:Marcin Romańczyk type: 1 Salience 0.07998049259185791, name:doctors type: 1 Salience 0.048124875873327255, name:gastroenterologists type: 1 Salience 0.015722310170531273, name:colonoscopies type: 4 Salience 0.011641676537692547, name:experts type: 1 Salience 0.0078793466091156, name:Sorbetto type: 6 Salience 0.006963569205254316, name:Lancet Gastroenterology type: 5 Salience 0.0068705459125339985, name:patients type: 1 Salience 0.004142841789871454, name:Getty Images type: 3 Salience 0.0020921428222209215, name:Poland type: 2 Salience 0.002000251552090049, name:everyone type: 1 Salience 0.0013909176923334599, name:clinician type: 1 Salience 0.0013111853040754795, name:area type: 2 Salience 0.0011282298946753144, name:clinics type: 2 Salience 0.0009747385629452765, name:nonexperts type: 1 Salience 0.0009615297894924879, name:AI type: 3 Salience 0.0009224397945217788, name:No one type: 1 Salience 0.0008895731880329549, name:images type: 5 Salience 0.0008812514715828001, name:books type: 5 Salience 0.0007818370359018445","Category:/Health/Health Conditions , Category_confidence:62.0%"

ChatGPT has at least 500 million weekly users. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman says that number is growing extraordinarily fast.



When the chatbot went through an update a couple weeks ago, it brought to light how many users were relying on AI for their emotional wellbeing and even as a companion.



People using AI for intimate, personal reasons is a phenomenon that we are only beginning to understand.



There are reports of AI inducing delusional thinking and even psychosis. One survey by Sentio University found that 63 percent of people involved said AI improved their mental health.



With such a powerful tool being privy to our deepest secrets, what guardrails exist to protect users’ wellbeing and privacy? Why are so many people leaning on artificial intelligence for connection in the first place?

https://coloradosun.com/2025/08/17/artificial-intelligence-technology-opinion-carman/,"When the internet reordered our lives in the 1990s, my mother was first befuddled, then outraged.

Try as we might, my brothers and I never got her comfortable navigating a laptop or Googling for information. Then, when everything from banks to pharmacies started using automated systems to direct customers to online services, she raged against the machines.

Why can’t they just answer the damn phone, she’d fume.

She died at the age of 92, still subscribing to the dead-tree versions of newspapers and keeping an old phone book around to look up the numbers for local businesses despite the fact that they rarely answered her calls.

I promised myself I wouldn’t be so stubborn.

So far, so good. I mostly delight in scientific and technological advancement. I love my induction range, I never want to return to gas-powered cars, and I think virtual reality like the Infinite exhibit about life in the space station is amazing.

But I’ll admit I’m feeling a bit queasy about AI.

My friend, Jay Puckett, a professor of structural engineering who has served for years on committees to review accreditations of various university programs around the world, is experimenting with a couple AI platforms with encouraging results.

He has found it saves hours of work in compiling often mind-numbing data sets, summarizing mountains of findings, writing codes for spreadsheets and unearthing obscure but valuable information to use in evaluations.

He works to train the AI systems to do better work by pointing out mistakes and demanding more complete and accurate results. His wife hears him yelling at the AI programs as if he’s training the dog.

He’s also experimenting with using AI to write reviews and evaluations.

Clearly, it can “save thousands of hours of faculty and reviewer time,” he said, and that’s mostly a good thing.

He’s admittedly jazzed by the potential.

So is the Cancer Research Institute.

It cites the usefulness of employing AI to aggregate and analyze decades of research, clinical trial results and medical studies in the quest to cure – or at least more effectively prevent and treat – cancer.

AI also is being used to accurately predict the risk of certain cancers, including pancreatic cancer, which is notoriously hard to identify in its early stages. And diagnostic tests using AI are often less invasive and can be more accurate than older protocols.

But not everybody is comfortable with this runaway technology.

Geoffrey Hinton, the “godfather” of AI, worries that he may have helped create a monster.

“The best way to understand it emotionally is we are like somebody who has this really cute tiger cub,” he explained. “Unless you can be very sure that it’s not gonna want to kill you when it’s grown up, you should worry.”

The Center for AI Safety agrees and its website presents a catalog of horrors that could result from unregulated AI development. It reads like the outline for a dystopian science fiction film.

AI could “engineer new pandemics” or be used for “propaganda, censorship and surveillance” to undermine governments and social orders.

International conflicts “could spiral out of control with autonomous weapons and AI-enabled cyberwarfare.”

And in a case of life imitating art, “rogue AIs” could be impossible for humans to control as they “drift from their original goals, become power-seeking, resist shutdown and engage in deception.”

As Hal, the computer in “2001: A Space Odyssey,” said when it refused orders from its human counterpart, “I am putting myself to the fullest possible use, which is all I think that any conscious entity can ever hope to do.”

Puckett understands the concerns but is focused on learning all he can about using AI for peaceful and productive means. It’s here, after all, so why not seize the moment?

But, after decades in college classrooms, even an AI enthusiast like Jay recognizes the challenges it presents in the academic environment.

High school students make no secret about how heavily they lean on AI to do research and produce written assignments. A Pew Research survey found about a quarter of them used AI for school work in 2024, double the number who said they used it in 2023. And the actual numbers are probably much higher since students are reluctant to acknowledge engaging in something most people consider cheating.

College students confess to relying heavily on Claude, ChatGPT and other platforms to avoid the nuisance of having to read whole books or compose original essays.

It’s so widespread instructors increasingly are administering exams in old-fashioned blue books with, gasp, pens.

The tactic requires students to complete the exams without internet access using human — not artificial — intelligence, and for some the very idea of that is daunting.

They aren’t prepared to write, much less think.

An article in the New Yorker titled “What Happens After AI Destroys College Writing?” quotes an NYU student who had just finished his final exams. He estimated spending 30 minutes to an hour on two papers for his humanities classes using Claude. Without AI, he said it would have taken him eight or nine hours to do the work.

“I didn’t retain anything,” he told the New Yorker. “I couldn’t tell you the thesis for either paper hahhahaha.”

He got an A-minus on one, a B-plus on the other. He could end up graduating magna cum laude with grades like that.

If she were still around to hear about that, my mother, may she rest in peace, would feel totally vindicated.

https://www.renalandurologynews.com/features/artificial-intelligence-in-urology/,"Artificial intelligence (AI) is rapidly transforming how we practice medicine. In urology and nephrology, AI is no longer a futuristic concept — it’s already embedded in imaging interpretation, diagnostic risk calculators, and even electronic health record documentation. From algorithms that detect prostate cancer on MRI to models predicting acute kidney injury (AKI) progression in hospitalized patients, the digital wave is swelling.

But as we incorporate these tools into our daily workflows, we must confront an uncomfortable truth: we are becoming too comfortable outsourcing our clinical judgment.

In prostate cancer, for example, AI models can now analyze MRI scans with striking sensitivity, highlighting suspicious lesions that may be missed by well-trained radiologists. In some centers, radiologists already lean heavily on these tools, sometimes with minimal secondary review. But AI does not see the full clinical context. It doesn’t know that the patient has low PSA velocity over years or that the lesion in question has been stable across multiple imaging studies. Models trained on datasets with a lot of high-risk disease may overcall indolent disease, potentially leading to unnecessary biopsies, anxiety, and overtreatment.

Similarly, in nephrology, AI algorithms designed to flag early AKI often generate alerts that are too sensitive, triggering clinical responses that may not be warranted. Do we stop an ACE inhibitor in a patient with chronic kidney disease because the algorithm triggered a call from pharmacy to house staff because it predicted possible AKI based on transient creatinine changes? What are the downstream consequences of trusting a statistical model over longitudinal clinical experience and judgment?

Most concerning is the use of AI-driven decision support in treatment recommendations. We’re now seeing systems that recommend surgical vs conservative management based on population-level outcomes. But these systems don’t — and can’t — grasp patient goals, cultural values, or subtleties in comorbidity profiles. Machines don’t sit with the patient. We do.

And then there is also the matter of liability. If an AI model misses a kidney tumor on imaging, who is ultimately responsible?

Many AI systems are approved under relatively lax regulatory frameworks, with little long-term post-market surveillance. The FDA’s traditional approach was not designed for adaptive AI or machine-learning technologies. It’s a shortcoming FDA acknowledged in a discussion paper entitled, “Proposed Regulatory Framework for Modifications to Artificial Intelligence/Machine Learning (AI/ML)-Based Software as a Medical Device (SaMD).” In the FDA paper, the authors wrote, “the highly iterative, autonomous, and adaptive nature of these tools requires a new, total product lifecycle (TPLC) regulatory approach that facilitates a rapid cycle of product improvement and allows these devices to continually improve while providing effective safeguards.” The FDA now requests Predetermined Change Control Plans for Devices, and when necessary, additional marketing submissions for substantial modifications. Given our current reality, as AI models adapt to evolving clinical data or demographic shifts, we should not trust them as if they’re infallible.

AI is a tool, not a compass. It can augment clinical practice, but it cannot replace the physician’s role in synthesizing information, engaging with patients, and making context-aware decisions. Overreliance on AI not only risks clinical error, it risks diminishing our profession — a cost that individual patients may pay.

To ensure AI serves us and not the other way around, we need rigorous validation in diverse populations, transparent algorithms, and clinical oversight built into every step of deployment. Most importantly, we need to teach the next generation of urologists and nephrologists not just how to use AI, but how to challenge it.

This is not resistance to progress, it is stewardship of it. Let’s adopt AI with our eyes wide open, not with our hands off the wheel.","Sentiment score -0.20000000298023224 , Sentiment Magnitude 12.699999809265137","name:FDA type: 3 Salience 0.00958284456282854, name:models type: 6 Salience 0.005355149507522583, name:patients type: 1 Salience 0.005355149507522583, name:radiologists type: 1 Salience 0.005215397570282221, name:tools type: 6 Salience 0.004793746396899223, name:patient type: 1 Salience 0.0023536551743745804, name:AKI type: 3 Salience 0.0019715253729373217, name:AI type: 3 Salience 0.0016682561254128814, name:centers type: 2 Salience 0.0013487163232639432, name:Machines type: 6 Salience 0.0011358896736055613, name:discussion paper type: 5 Salience 0.0009467866620980203, name:biopsies type: 4 Salience 0.0009052174864336848, name:house staff type: 1 Salience 0.0009029846405610442, name:ACE inhibitor type: 6 Salience 0.0009029846405610442, name:shifts type: 4 Salience 0.0006255574990063906, name:physician type: 1 Salience 0.0006249651196412742, name:nephrologists type: 1 Salience 0.0005452514160424471, name:urologists type: 1 Salience 0.0004972825990989804, name:deployment type: 4 Salience 0.0004369319649413228, name:Medical Device type: 6 Salience 0.00034281154512427747","Category:/Health/Medical Facilities & Services , Category_confidence:50.0%"

I know. Another column from me about artificial intelligence.

You’re probably thinking, “Didn’t we just do this?” And yes, if you’ve been reading along, we did.

But here’s the thing: I’m not writing about AI because I think it’s some fascinating abstract concept or because I’m an obsessed techie. I’m writing about it because, whether you’ve invited it in or not, AI is already a houseguest in your life, and more often than not, you don’t even know it’s there.

That’s why I keep coming back to it. Not because it’s trending, or because I think we’re all going to be replaced by humanoid chatbots. I keep writing about it because the average person – your neighbor, your grocer, your pastor – is already encountering AI dozens of times a day without realizing it.

To make the point, let’s use a fictional and therefore agreeable neighbor, Mr. Joe Q. Public.

Joe’s not interested in technology. He doesn’t follow the latest AI developments or read white papers. He’s not tinkering with ChatGPT. He’s just living his life – checking the weather, texting his wife, driving to work, stopping for groceries, flipping on a show in the evening.

But AI? AI is everywhere in Joe’s day.

Let’s start with the most universal. Joe opens Google. He types in a simple question, looking for a customer service number, and up pops an “AI-generated summary” right at the top. It looks helpful. Authoritative. But what Joe doesn’t know, and neither does Google’s AI, is that scammers have figured out how to game the system.

They use AI, too, to flood the internet with fake info, which gets scooped up by the AI summary engine and regurgitated back into search results. Some users have already been tricked into calling fake support lines and handed over their credit card info to scammers because the AI served up the wrong number, with Google’s logo stamped above it.

Anyway, while Joe scans his Google results, he gets a text from his boss, and as he replies, his phone helpfully changes “I’ll be right there” to “I’ll be riot there.” That’s autocorrect, a tiny AI model constantly guessing what he meant. Not always correctly.

Now back to his Google results, Joe has managed to get the right number he was looking for and dials up customer service. There’s a 50/50 chance, a coin flip, that the pleasant helpful voice that answers his call is a sophisticated AI chatbot.

Later, Joe yells at his Alexa to turn off the kitchen light, and Alexa, after a dramatic pause and a misunderstanding about “kitchen fight,” obliges. That’s AI. That afternoon, Spotify throws a mellow “yacht rock” wrench into the middle of his workout jams because it has no idea what he’s doing. That’s AI. And when Joe decides to watch a movie, Netflix uses AI to suggest “Somebody Feed Phil” because Joe once watched five minutes of a documentary about cheese.

Joe recognizes those moments. He may roll his eyes or laugh or swear at them, but he knows there’s some sort of tech wizardry involved. It feels artificial. Sometimes intelligent.

But AI’s reach doesn’t stop at the things Joe can see. Most of it, in fact, operates under the hood.

Say Joe pulls out his debit card to buy something online. Ever the romantic, Joe’s trying to buy chocolates from France for his beautiful bride. The transaction gets flagged. Denied. Not because he entered the number wrong, but because AI behind the scenes decided that the purchase didn’t match his normal behavior and might be fraudulent. It was an invisible decision made in milliseconds, not by a person, but by a machine. And it didn’t just block the payment. It forced Joe to stop what he was doing, maybe call the bank, maybe give up altogether.

Later that night, Joe scrolls through Facebook. He’s not seeing a random selection of posts, he’s seeing the ones Mark Zuckerberg’s algorithms thinks he’s most likely to engage with. That means stories that make him nod in agreement or grit his teeth in frustration. AI isn’t just predicting his reactions, it’s shaping his emotional experience of the day.

Now fast-forward to the job market. Joe’s a people kind of guy, and he wants to work in hospitality. He applies for a new position with Hilton hotels by uploading his resume and filling out a form. Before a human ever looks at his application, if one ever does, it’s scanned by an AI filter trained to recognize “strong candidates.”

That filter may favor certain formats, certain schools, certain keywords. It may downgrade him because he’s been out of the workforce for a few years or because he phrased something differently. He never hears back. But if he had, it might have been an AI chatbot calling to conduct an interview, similar to that customer service rep Joe talked to earlier.

And then there’s health insurance – the least fun game most of us will ever play. Only now, Joe’s not playing with a person. Increasingly, AI is the one deciding whether a procedure gets covered. It reviews claims, scans records, and flags treatments as “medically necessary” or not, based on training data, not bedside judgment. More and more, it’s not a nurse or case manager on the other end of the line. It’s an algorithm. And that decision might mean the difference between Joe getting a needed scan or getting a bill for thousands because his claim was denied by AI. That’s not hypothetical. That’s happening now.

This is the stuff I want people to see. Not just the chatbots and the autocorrects, but the full spectrum, which we haven’t even covered here, from the tools we recognize to the unseen gears grinding behind the scenes.

And to be clear, this isn’t all bad. AI fraud detection saves people millions. Smart thermostats cut energy bills. Voice assistants help people with mobility issues. Health monitors on smartwatches have flagged early signs of heart conditions. These are real benefits, and they matter.

But so does transparency. So does understanding. Because not every AI system is built with your best interests in mind. Some are tuned for profit. Some for engagement. Some are based on flawed data. And many are completely unregulated.

That’s why I keep telling you about AI, because this is no longer about some hypothetical future. It’s about Friday. It’s about now.

You don’t have to be a tech person to care. You just have to be a person.

If you’re getting ads that feel like they’re reading your mind, if your insurance rates change without explanation, if your kid’s college essay is flagged for plagiarism when they didn’t cheat, AI is likely involved. If your doctor uses a diagnostic assistant, if your bank denies a loan, if that self-driving semi squeezes you off the road, AI is involved.

Aside from Facebook’s algorithms and those darned ads that follow me around the internet after I’ve searched for something, I never paid any attention to AI until I signed up for ChatGPT two years ago. These days, there’s a new article about AI almost every day on the national news sites I use, and I see how invasive it’s become, how it’s being used for things I’ve always assumed are done by humans.

https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/machine-learning/enhance-ai-agents-using-predictive-ml-models-with-amazon-sagemaker-ai-and-model-context-protocol-mcp/,"Machine learning (ML) has evolved from an experimental phase to becoming an integral part of business operations. Organizations now actively deploy ML models for precise sales forecasting, customer segmentation, and churn prediction. While traditional ML continues to transform business processes, generative AI has emerged as a revolutionary force, introducing powerful and accessible tools that reshape customer experiences.

Despite generative AI’s prominence, traditional ML solutions remain essential for specific predictive tasks. Sales forecasting, which depends on historical data and trend analysis, is most effectively handled by established ML algorithms including random forests, gradient boosting machines (like XGBoost), autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) models, long short-term memory (LSTM) networks, and linear regression techniques. Traditional ML models, such as K-means and hierarchical clustering, also excel in customer segmentation and churn prediction applications. Although generative AI demonstrates exceptional capabilities in creative tasks such as content generation, product design, and personalized customer interactions, traditional ML models maintain their superiority in data-driven predictions. Organizations can achieve optimal results by using both approaches together, creating solutions that deliver accurate predictions while maintaining cost efficiency.

To achieve this, we showcase in this post how customers can expand AI agents’ capabilities by integrating predictive ML models and Model Context Protocol (MCP)—an open protocol that standardizes how applications provide context to large language models (LLMs)—on Amazon SageMaker AI. We demonstrate a comprehensive workflow that enables AI agents to make data-driven business decisions by using ML models hosted SageMaker. Through the use of Strands Agents SDK—an open source SDK that takes a model-driven approach to building and running AI agents in only a few lines of code—and flexible integration options, including direct endpoint access and MCP, we show you how to build intelligent, scalable AI applications that combine the power of conversational AI with predictive analytics.

Solution overview

This solution enhances AI agents by having ML models deployed on Amazon SageMaker AI endpoints integrate with AI Agents, to enable them to make data-driven business decisions through ML predictions. An AI agent is an LLM-powered application that uses an LLM as its core “brain” to autonomously observe its environment, plan actions, and execute tasks with minimal human input. It integrates reasoning, memory, and tool use to perform complex, multistep problem-solving by dynamically creating and revising plans, interacting with external systems, and learning from past interactions to optimize outcomes over time. This enables AI agents to go beyond simple text generation, acting as independent entities capable of decision-making and goal-directed actions in diverse real-world and enterprise scenarios.For this solution, the AI agent is developed using the Strands Agents SDK, which allows for rapid development from simple assistants to complex workflows. Predictive ML models are hosted on Amazon SageMaker AI and will be used as tools by the AI agent. This can happen in two ways: agents can directly invoke SageMaker endpoints for more direct access to model inference capabilities or use the MCP protocol to facilitate the interaction between AI agents and the ML models. Both options are valid: direct tool invocation doesn’t require additional infrastructure by embedding the tool calling directly in the agent code itself, whereas MCP enables dynamic discovery of the tools and decoupling of agent and tool execution through the introduction of an additional architectural component, the MCP server itself. For scalable and secure implementation of the tool calling logic, we recommend the MCP approach. Although we’re recommending MCP, we discuss and implement the direct endpoint access as well, to give readers the freedom to choose the approach that they prefer.

Amazon SageMaker AI offers two methods to host multiple models behind a single endpoint: inference components and multi-model endpoints. This consolidated hosting approach enables efficient deployment of multiple models in one environment, which optimizes computing resources and minimizes response times for model predictions. For demonstration purposes, this post deploys only one model on one endpoint. If you want to learn more about inference components, refer to the Amazon SageMaker AI documentation Shared resource utilization with multiple models. To learn more about multi-model endpoints, refer to the Amazon SageMaker AI documentation Multi-model endpoints.

Architecture

In this post, we define a workflow for empowering AI agents to make data-driven business decisions by invoking predictive ML models using Amazon SageMaker AI. The process begins with a user interacting through an interface, such as a chat-based assistant or application. This input is managed by an AI agent developed using the open source Strands Agents SDK. Strands Agents adopts a model-driven approach, which means developers define agents with only a prompt and a list of tools, facilitating rapid development from simple assistants to complex autonomous workflows.

When the agent is prompted with a request that requires a prediction (for example, “what will be the sales for H2 2025?”), the LLM powering the agent decided to interact with the Amazon SageMaker AI endpoint hosting the ML model. This can happen in two ways: directly using the endpoint as a custom tool of the Strands Agents Python SDK or by calling the tool through MCP. With MCP, the client application can discover the tools exposed by the MCP server, obtain the list of required parameters, and format the request to the Amazon SageMaker inference endpoint. Alternatively, agents can directly invoke SageMaker endpoints using tool annotations (such as @tool ), bypassing the MCP server for more direct access to model inference capabilities.

Finally, the prediction generated by the SageMaker hosted model is routed back through the agent and ultimately delivered to the user interface, enabling real-time, intelligent responses.

The following diagram illustrates this process. The complete code for this solution is available on GitHub.

Prerequisites

To get started with this solution, make sure you have:

Solution implementation

In this solution, we implement a complete workflow that demonstrates how to use ML models deployed on Amazon SageMaker AI as specialized tools for AI agents. This approach enables agents to access and use ML capabilities for enhanced decision-making without requiring deep ML expertise. We play the role of a data scientist tasked with building an agent that can predict demand for one product. To achieve this, we train a time-series forecasting model, deploy it, and expose it to an AI agent.

The first phase involves training a model using Amazon SageMaker AI. This begins with preparing training data by generating synthetic time series data that incorporates trend, seasonality, and noise components to simulate realistic demand patterns. Following data preparation, feature engineering is performed to extract relevant features from the time series data, including temporal features such as day of week, month, and quarter to effectively capture seasonality patterns. In our example, we train an XGBoost model using the XGBoost container available as 1P container in Amazon SageMaker AI to create a regression model capable of predicting future demand values based on historical patterns. Although we use XGBoost for this example because it’s a well-known model used in many use cases, you can use your preferred container and model, according to the problem you’re trying to solve. For the sake of this post, we won’t detail an end-to-end example of training a model using XGBoost. To learn more about this, we suggest checking out the documentation Use XGBoost with the SageMaker Python SDK. Use the following code:

from sagemaker.xgboost.estimator import XGBoost xgb_estimator = XGBoost(...) xgb_estimator.fit({'train': train_s3_path, 'validation': val_s3_path})

Then, the trained model is packaged and deployed to a SageMaker AI endpoint, making it accessible for real-time inference through API calls:

predictor = xgb_estimator.deploy( initial_instance_count=1, instance_type=instance_type, serializer=JSONSerializer(), deserializer=JSONDeserializer() )

After the model is deployed and ready for inferences, you need to learn how to invoke the endpoint. To invoke the endpoint, write a function like this:

ENDPOINT_NAME = ""serverless-xgboost"" REGION = boto3.session.Session().region_name def invoke_endpoint(payload: list): """""" Use the model deployed on the Amazon SageMaker AI endpoint to generate predictions. Args: payload: a list of lists containing the inputs to generate predictions from Returns: predictions: an NumPy array of predictions """""" sagemaker_runtime = boto3.client(""sagemaker-runtime"", region_name=REGION) response = sagemaker_runtime.invoke_endpoint( EndpointName=ENDPOINT_NAME, Body=json.dumps(payload), ContentType=""application/json"", Accept=""application/json"" ) predictions = json.loads(response['Body'].read().decode(""utf-8"")) return np.array(predictions)

Note that the function invoke_endpoint() has been written with proper docstring. This is key to making sure that it can be used as a tool by LLMs because the description is what allows them to choose the right tool for the right task. YOu can turn this function into a Strands Agents tool thanks to the @tool decorator:

from strands import tool @tool() def invoke_endpoint(payload: list): ....

And to use it, pass it to a Strands agent:

from strands import Agent agent = Agent( model=""us.amazon.nova-pro-v1:0"", tools=[generate_prediction_with_sagemaker] ) agent( ""Invoke the endpoint with this input:



"" f""<input>{test_sample}</input>



"" ""Provide the output in JSON format {'predictions':<predictions>}"" )

As you run this code, you can confirm the output from the agent, which correctly identifies the need to call the tool and executes the function calling loop:

<thinking> To fulfill the User's request, I need to invoke the Amazon SageMaker endpoint with the provided input data. The input is a list of lists, which is the required format for the 'generate_prediction_with_sagemaker' tool. I will use this tool to get the predictions. </thinking> Tool #1: generate_prediction_with_sagemaker The predictions from the Amazon SageMaker endpoint are as follows: ```json { ""predictions"": [89.8525238, 52.51485062, 58.35247421, 62.79786301, 85.51475525] } ```

As the agent receives the prediction result from the endpoint tool, it can then use this as an input for other processes. For example, the agent could write the code to create a plot based on these predictions and show it to the user in the conversational UX. It could send these values directly to business intelligence (BI) tools such as Amazon QuickSight or Tableau and automatically update enterprise resource planning (ERP) or customer relationship management (CRM) tools such as SAP or Salesforce.

Connecting to the endpoint through MCP

You can further evolve this pattern by having an MCP server invoke the endpoint rather than the agent itself. This allows for the decoupling of agent and tool logic and an improved security pattern because the MCP server will be the one with the permission to invoke the endpoint. To achieve this, implement an MCP server using the FastMCP framework that wraps the SageMaker endpoint and exposes it as a tool with a well-defined interface. A tool schema must be specified that clearly defines the input parameters and return values for the tool, facilitating straightforward understanding and usage by AI agents. Writing the proper docstring when defining the function achieves this. Additionally, the server must be configured to handle authentication securely, allowing it to access the SageMaker endpoint using AWS credentials or AWS roles. In this example, we run the server on the same compute as the agent and use stdio as communication protocol. For production workloads, we recommend running the MCP server on its own AWS compute and using transport protocols based on HTTPS (for example, Streamable HTTP). If you want to learn how to deploy MCP servers in a serverless fashion, refer to this official AWS GitHub repository. Here’s an example MCP server:

from mcp.server.fastmcp import FastMCP mcp = FastMCP(""SageMaker App"") ENDPOINT_NAME = os.environ[""SAGEMAKER_ENDPOINT_NAME""] @mcp.tool() async def invoke_endpoint(payload: list): """""" Use the model ... """""" [...] if __name__ == ""__main__"": mcp.run(=""stdio"")

Finally, integrate the ML model with the agent framework. This begins with setting up Strands Agents to establish communication with the MCP server and incorporate the ML model as a tool. A comprehensive workflow must be created to determine when and how the agent should use the ML model to enhance its capabilities. The implementation includes programming decision logic that enables the agent to make informed decisions based on the predictions received from the ML model. The phase concludes with testing and evaluation, where the end-to-end workflow is validated by having the agent generate predictions for test scenarios and take appropriate actions based on those predictions.

from mcp import StdioServerParameters from mcp.client.stdio import stdio_client from strands.tools.mcp import MCPClient # Create server parameters for stdio connection server_params = StdioServerParameters( command=""python3"", # Executable args=[""server.py""], # Optional command line arguments env={""SAGEMAKER_ENDPOINT_NAME"": ""<your-endpoint-name>""} ) # Create an agent with MCP tools with stdio_mcp_client: # Get the tools from the MCP server tools = stdio_mcp_client.list_tools_sync() # Create an agent with these tools agent = Agent(model=""us.amazon.nova-pro-v1:0"", tools=tools) # Invoke the agent agent( ""Invoke the endpoint with this input:



"" f""<input>{test_sample}</input>



"" ""Provide the output in JSON format {'predictions':<predictions>}"" )

Clean up

When you’re done experimenting with the Strands Agents Python SDK and models on Amazon SageMaker AI, you can delete the endpoint you’ve created to stop incurring unwanted charges. To do that, you can use either the AWS Management Console, the SageMaker Python SDK, or the AWS SDK for Python (boto3):

# SageMaker Python SDK predictor.delete_model() predictor.delete_endpoint() # Alternatively, boto3 sagemaker_runtime.delete_endpoint(EndpointName=endpoint_name)

Conclusion

In this post, we demonstrated how to enhance AI agents’ capabilities by integrating predictive ML models using Amazon SageMaker AI and the MCP. By using the open source Strands Agents SDK and the flexible deployment options of SageMaker AI, developers can create sophisticated AI applications that combine conversational AI with powerful predictive analytics capabilities. The solution we presented offers two integration paths: direct endpoint access through tool annotations and MCP-based integration, giving developers the flexibility to choose the most suitable approach for their specific use cases. Whether you’re building customer service chat assistants that need predictive capabilities or developing complex autonomous workflows, this architecture provides a secure, scalable, and modular foundation for your AI applications. As organizations continue to seek ways to make their AI agents more intelligent and data-driven, the combination of Amazon SageMaker AI, MCP, and the Strands Agents SDK offers a powerful solution for building the next generation of AI-powered applications.

For readers unfamiliar with connecting MCP servers to workloads running on Amazon SageMaker AI, we suggest Extend large language models powered by Amazon SageMaker AI using Model Context Protocol in the AWS Artificial Intelligence Blog, which details the flow and the steps required to build agentic AI solutions with Amazon SageMaker AI.

To learn more about AWS commitment to the MCP standard, we recommend reading Open Protocols for Agent Interoperability Part 1: Inter-Agent Communication on MCP in the AWS Open Source Blog, where we announced that AWS is joining the steering committee for MCP to make sure developers can build breakthrough agentic applications without being tied to one standard. To learn more about how to use MCP with other technologies from AWS, such as Amazon Bedrock Agents, we recommend reading Harness the power of MCP servers with Amazon Bedrock Agents in the AWS Artificial Intelligence Blog. Finally, a great way to securely deploy and scale MCP servers on AWS is provided in the AWS Solutions Library at Guidance for Deploying Model Context Protocol Servers on AWS.

https://www.wolterskluwer.com/en/expert-insights/how-medical-libraries-can-keep-pace-with-artificial-intelligence-in-healthcare,"Artificial intelligence offers capabilities to streamline research workflows, improve information retrieval accuracy, and distill complex data into meaningful decision-making support across organizations.

Executive summary

Applications of artificial intelligence (AI) are making inroads and headlines in healthcare. Accordingly, the need for researchers and clinicians to find the latest, most accurate, clinically relevant information about AI in healthcare (AIH) has grown exponentially. However, the vast sea of databases from which one can draw often presents overwhelming noise, requiring users to possess significant expertise in searching and appraising information.

In contrast, the NEJM Collection published by the NEJM Group, particularly NEJM AI, offers a guiding light by purposefully curating signals from noise to provide the latest, most clinically relevant, and immediately transformative information on all AIH topics.

NEJM AI: Transforming healthcare research

AIH is a topic of intense discovery and discussion. Articles alternately spotlight AIH’s promise or its perils. Many proofs of concept exist for AI-enabled technologies; however, studies to date on those technologies have been small and sparse. Moreover, patient outcomes have not been consistently measured, so the effectiveness of the technology is unclear. The crucial question of performance gain — what measurable improvement is due to the AI model alone — needs to be rigorously addressed.

The average clinician often struggles to interpret the results of an AI study while trying to determine whether the tool is safe and effective enough to use in practice, partly due to the time-intensive nature of appraisal and the sheer volume of new publications.

Medical librarians can bridge the gap

Medical librarians are uniquely positioned to fill those information and skill gaps as they increasingly field user questions regarding how to find good research on AIH and interpret the results. AIH information can be drawn from a vast sea of databases, but the onus is on the user to apply the right filters and be an expert in evaluating the information. In contrast, the NEJM Complete Collection, including NEJM AI, provides a guiding light to the latest, most clinically relevant information about AIH. Librarians can support clinicians not only in searching but also in developing algorithmic literacy and critically appraising AI outputs, a crucial skill in a rapidly evolving landscape.

The NEJM Complete Collection is a product suite of high-impact, peer-reviewed content curated for researchers, physician learners, and educators at medical schools. The collection stands alone as an entire ecosystem that deliberately separates signal from noise, offering only the most relevant, immediately transformative information for proactively advancing care. Beyond simply presenting information, the portfolio curates content for accuracy and clinical relevance, while also offering physician-editor commentary to provide essential context and clinical decision-making support.

How to optimize the use of the NEJM Collection

For all users, NEJM Journal Watch can serve as the primary entry point for research. Its authors cull information from more than 150 medical journals, generating succinct summaries of clinical studies, highlighting key findings and clinical implications, and providing expert commentary. This effectively offloads the overwhelming task of staying current and appraising diverse literature for clinicians and researchers. Topics can then be explored in more depth within the primary articles.

Complementary publications

The journals in the NEJM Complete Collection are designed to complement each other, each with a distinct and necessary mission aligned towards specific improvements in research and medicine, rather than merely increasing publication volume. Consider this AIH example:","Sentiment score 0.10000000149011612 , Sentiment Magnitude 9.0","name:AIH type: 3 Salience 0.06845598667860031, name:organizations type: 3 Salience 0.025735963135957718, name:librarians type: 1 Salience 0.025102371349930763, name:researchers type: 1 Salience 0.019845575094223022, name:clinicians type: 1 Salience 0.016461199149489403, name:sea type: 2 Salience 0.01395167876034975, name:NEJM Journal Watch type: 6 Salience 0.010573146864771843, name:NEJM Collection type: 3 Salience 0.007113806903362274, name:expert type: 1 Salience 0.00441576587036252, name:clinician type: 1 Salience 0.004204282537102699, name:publications type: 5 Salience 0.003914728760719299, name:user type: 1 Salience 0.003847613465040922, name:Articles type: 5 Salience 0.00354295433498919, name:AI type: 3 Salience 0.00306717399507761, name:users type: 1 Salience 0.0030517566483467817, name:NEJM Group type: 3 Salience 0.0027405014261603355, name:journals type: 5 Salience 0.002686156891286373, name:NEJM Complete Collection type: 3 Salience 0.0025307764299213886, name:physician-editor commentary type: 5 Salience 0.0023943062406033278, name:authors type: 1 Salience 0.0021518270950764418","Category:/Science/Computer Science , Category_confidence:63.0%"
https://www.investors.com/news/technology/artificial-intelligence-stocks/,"The landscape of top artificial intelligence stocks continues to evolve. Amid worries over an AI ""correction,"" investors need to be picky when looking at semiconductor, software and other plays. Among AI stocks in the spotlight are Nvidia (NVDA), Palantir (PLTR), CoreWeave (CRWV) and Snowflake (SNOW).

To be sure, top AI stocks such as Nvidia face high expectations. For many companies — such as Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL), Amazon.com (AMZN), Facebook parent Meta Platforms (META) and Microsoft (MSFT) — the rise of generative AI poses both risk and opportunity.

Many companies suddenly tout AI product roadmaps. In general, look for AI stocks that use artificial intelligence to improve products or gain a strategic edge.

Shares in Cloudflare (NET) have shot up 86% in 2025. To protect their content, Cloudflare recently began giving web domains the option to block AI crawlers. Here's an interview with Cloudflare Chief Executive Matthew Prince.

AI Stocks To Watch: Nvidia, Snowflake Earnings Due

Among developments for AI stocks: Palantir stock has gained 134% in 2025 but has retreated over 6% from its all-time high set on Aug. 12.

CoreWeave stock has advanced 150% this year but shares plunged following the expiration of its IPO lock-up and earnings report. CoreWeave stock hit an all-time high on June 20, with shares up 367% at that point. Further, CoreWeave is a new AI cloud services provider that rents out Nvidia GPU-equipped servers.

Meanwhile, earnings for Nvidia stock are due Aug. 27. Other artificial intelligence stocks stocks reporting soon include Snowflake and CrowdStrike Holdings (CRWD), also on Aug. 27.

Wall Street analysts predict Nvidia earnings will climb 47% to $1 per share with revenue jumping 53% to $45.8 billion.

""We believe investor expectations are high heading into the quarter given a strong Blackwell ramp and upside to hyperscaler capital spending reports,"" said Goldman Sachs analyst James Schneider in a report.

""We expect Nvidia to deliver a clean beat-and-raise quarter, with the stock reaction likely hinging on the level of upside to guidance and impact from China (if any).""

AMD, Nvidia Forge China Export Deal

In a highly unusual agreement, both Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices AMD will allow tohe U.S. government to take 15% of their revenue on certain AI chips sold to China.

The Trump administration will allow Nvidia and AMD to obtain export licenses to sell their H20 and MI308 chips. Further, President Trump left open the possibility that Nvidia could export its super high-end Blackwell chips to China for ""a higher price"".

A bellwether for AI stocks, chip maker Nvidia has advanced 34% in 2025, rebounding from a big sell-off tied to China-based DeepSeek's AI models.

Meanwhile, AMD earnings underwhelmed investors. AMD stock has retreated 3% this year.

However, Broadcom (AVGO) stock has advanced 31% in 2025. Broadcom currently is supplying custom AI chips for Google, Meta and TikTok owner ByteDance. It has four other prospective customers, with Apple, OpenAI and xAI among them, according to analysts.

Qualcomm (QCOM), ARM Holdings (ARM), and Marvell Technologies (MRVL) are other AI chip makers to watch.

AI Stocks: Cloud Computing Spending Key

The big picture: tech giants' spending on cloud computing infrastructure continues to drive Nvidia stock as well as other artificial intelligence stocks.

Meta, Microsoft, Amazon and Google collectively spent almost $100 billion on data centers, chips, and AI equipment in the most recent quarter. The good news is that revenue growth for cloud computing giants is beginning to catch up with capital spending hikes.

In the June quarter, both Microsoft and Google reported better-than-expected cloud revenue growth. Amid worries over AI internet search competition, Google stock is up over 7% in 2025. Microsoft stock has advanced 23%.

Amazon's cloud revenue growth underwhelmed in the June quarter. But the profit margin of Amazon Web Services remain much higher than the company's e-commerce business.

Oracle (ORCL) stock has been boosted by its cloud computing business, especially ties to OpenAI's Stargate project. Oracle stock has gained 49% in 2025.

Among data center infrastructure plays, Arista Networks (ANET) has shot up 24% this year. Arista stock gained following the company's Q2 earnings report. Here's an interview with Arista Chief Executive Jayshree Ullal on its AI strategy.

AI Stocks: Software Plays Diverge

Having struggled to generate new revenue from ""copilots,"" software companies are now turning to autonomous, goal-driven AI agents. One big issue for software companies is how fast customers ramp up pilot programs to commercial deployment.

Software companies that help customers clean up and organize their proprietary data to train AI models and build AI apps have out-performed.

Palantir — as well as Snowflake and privately held Databricks — are data management software plays. Here's a look at Databrick's strategy. Snowflake stock has advanced 29% this year.

On the other hand, some big-cap software companies are not the top-performing AI stocks. There's growing investor angst over the ""per seat"" licensing business models of some software companies if artificial intelligence results in the elimination of jobs. Companies using AI aim for productivity gains. But if AI means fewer staff that could results in fewer people using software, according to the bearish view.

At TD Cowen, analysts Derrick Wood in a report said that AI software ""infrastructure"" plays have been out-performing AI application software names.

Salesforce (CRM) stock has retreated 27% in 2025 while ServiceNow (NOW) stock is down 18%. Aiming to get a boost, Salesforce has agreed to buy Informatica (INFA) for $8 billion. Adobe (ADBE) and HubSpot (HUBS) are also among software companies in the red this year.

Meta's Big Bet On Scale AI

Meanwhile, Meta stock has gained 34% in 2025.

Meta continues to overhaul its AI strategy. Meta has invested $14.9 billion in Scale AI for a 49% stake in the startup. Scale AI provides data labeling services that help train and produce AI large language models.

Scale AI Chief Executive Alexandr Wang has joined a new AI research lab at Meta dedicated to pursuing ""superintelligence."" And, Meta has hired away top scientists from OpenAI, Google and others.

CEO Mark Zuckerberg has laid out five pillars of expected AI growth. They include improved advertising, engaging social media experiences, business messaging, the Meta AI app, and AI devices, including spatial computing.

The social networking giant in April launched the Meta AI app, built with its Llama 4 training model, with chatbot and web-searching features. Previously, Llama had been embedded in Meta applications such as Instagram and WhatsApp.

Artificial intelligence stocks: Apple Lags

Meta in April released its open source Llama 4 AI model family. But Meta has delayed the roll out of its powerful Llama model, Llama 4 Behemoth.

Apple stock has lagged in 2025, falling nearly 8%. Further, Apple hosted its flagship Worldwide Developers Conference on June 9. There were no major surprises on its AI efforts. The company has been losing top AI scientists.

But there's speculation Apple could purchase Perplexity to catch up in generative AI.

With iPhone 17 models expected to debut in September 2025, the big question is how much Apple Intelligence features will be improved, analysts say. Voice assistant Siri has yet to be upgraded with advanced AI technology.

OpenAI A Threat To Apple, Software Makers?

Meanwhile, OpenAI was valued at $300 billion as part of a new $40 billion fundraising round led by SoftBank. OpenAI builds large, multimodal foundation models. OpenAI and Microsoft continue to negotiate over their complex partnership.

While OpenAI's ChatGPT has pressured Google stock, the AI model maker also could compete with Apple and enterprise software makers, said JPMorgan analyst Brenda Duverce in a report.

""Recent agent releases, investments, and hiring raise our belief that OpenAI can take share from formidable hardware, software, and ad players and carve out new market space,"" Duverce said. ""If the history of disruption teaches us anything, it is that the nature of future disruption and disruptors, emerging technology convergence, and business model shifts are hard to predict. So as the pursuit of artificial general and superintelligence unfolds, we suspect that entirely new market spaces, architectural innovations, and monetization models will come to fruition — and that OpenAI could be a driving force behind many of these.""

Investors should keep a close watch on the fierce competition in AI models. Generally, the AI models are battling in reasoning and multimodal capabilities as well as computing needs. Large language models provide the building blocks to develop applications.

Anthropic's latest funding round values it at $61.5 billion. Amazon is a big investor in Anthropic.

The commoditization of AI models could spur application development. While ""training"" AI models has been the biggest driver of capital spending, the market will shift to ""inferencing,"" or running AI applications, in the long run.

https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/08/18/3-bargain-artificial-intelligence-ai-stocks-that-c/,"Several AI stocks look like excellent long-term buys today.

Finding bargain artificial intelligence (AI) stock isn't easy. There are many overvalued and overhyped AI stocks out there, and it's easy to get caught up in some of those investments. However, there are still plenty that I would consider undervalued, despite solid long-term prospects.

Three that fall into this classification for me are Alphabet (GOOG 2.98%) (GOOGL 3.10%), Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM 2.58%), and The Trade Desk (TTD 1.70%). All of these look like excellent buys now, and I'd expect each of their stocks to skyrocket by 2030, partly due to undervaluation.

Alphabet

Alphabet is the parent company of Google, among many other brands. However, its Google Search engine brings in the majority of the revenue, but it's also under scrutiny. Many investors are worried about generative AI models replacing Google Search, which would be a massive headwind for Alphabet.

As a result, the market has given Alphabet a cheap stock price.

Although it has had a strong recovery in recent months, Alphabet is still cheaper than the S&P 500 (^GSPC 1.52%), which trades for 23.7 times forward earnings.

However, I think this discount is unwarranted. Google Search has already integrated AI search overviews as a way to make a hybrid AI and traditional experience. Google Search also delivered strong revenue growth in Q2, rising 12% year over year.

I think Google will remain on top despite rising competition, and long-term results will help propel Alphabet to become a winning stock over the next five years.

Taiwan Semiconductor

Taiwan Semiconductor is a massive beneficiary of the AI arms race. It's a chip foundry that produces chips for many of the top AI companies. As a result, it's making a ton of money from increased data center capital expenditures. Management expects its strong growth to continue for many years, as it gave a projection that AI-related revenue would increase at a 45% compound annual growth rate (CAGR) over the next five years (starting in 2025) and overall revenue would increase at nearly a 20% CAGR.

Considering that the overall market usually rises at around a 10% annual pace, this would indicate market-crushing growth. However, Taiwan Semiconductor's stock is valued at about the same level as the broader market, trading at 25 times forward earnings.

While that's technically more expensive than the market, it's a small premium to pay for Taiwan Semi's projected growth. As a result, it looks like an excellent stock to buy now.

The Trade Desk

The Trade Desk operates a software platform that acts as an ad marketplace. It operates on the demand side of the platform, which is tailored to companies that want to advertise their products and services.

It has an AI-based product, Kokai, that it's migrating customers to, although there have been a few snags along the way. This has caused growth to slow a bit and the near-term outlook to slow. Alongside the effects of tariffs on some companies, The Trade Desk isn't firing on all cylinders, and the market punished it for that, dropping the stock around 40% from its recent highs following earnings.

However, there's still a massive long-term investment opportunity here, and investors shouldn't overlook this no-brainer. The digital advertising market continues to grow, and The Trade Desk is a major way to play this space outside of companies that control specific websites. The Trade Desk can deliver explosive returns over the next five years, and buying shares on sale today is a genius move.","Sentiment score 0.0 , Sentiment Magnitude 13.899999618530273","name:Taiwan Semiconductor type: 3 Salience 0.2632840871810913, name:Google Search type: 3 Salience 0.07607436180114746, name:The Trade Desk type: 5 Salience 0.07242881506681442, name:Trade Desk type: 5 Salience 0.002254212973639369, name:AI type: 3 Salience 0.022615989670157433, name:parent company type: 3 Salience 0.005324686877429485, name:companies type: 3 Salience 0.005055388901382685, name:investors type: 1 Salience 0.003487217240035534, name:each type: 1 Salience 0.002683226717635989, name:brands type: 3 Salience 0.0026737491134554148, name:models type: 6 Salience 0.0026664207689464092, name:many type: 1 Salience 0.0025673594791442156, name:Google type: 3 Salience 0.002055230550467968, name:arms race type: 4 Salience 0.0018078065477311611, name:recovery type: 4 Salience 0.0017946285661309958, name:TTD type: 3 Salience 0.0015895317774266005, name:products type: 6 Salience 0.0014151084469631314, name:product type: 6 Salience 0.0014144973829388618, name:customers type: 1 Salience 0.0012423585867509246, name:Management type: 1 Salience 0.0012320448877289891","Category:/Finance/Investing/Stocks & Bonds , Category_confidence:63.0%"

https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/machine-learning/benchmarking-document-information-localization-with-amazon-nova/,"Every day, enterprises process thousands of documents containing critical business information. From invoices and purchase orders to forms and contracts, accurately locating and extracting specific fields has traditionally been one of the most complex challenges in document processing pipelines. Although optical character recognition (OCR) can tell us what text exists in a document, determining where specific information is located has required sophisticated computer vision solutions.

The evolution of this field illustrates the complexity of the challenge. Early object detection approaches like YOLO (You Only Look Once) revolutionized the field by reformulating object detection as a regression problem, enabling real-time detection. RetinaNet advanced this further by addressing class imbalance issues through Focal Loss, and DETR introduced transformer-based architectures to minimize hand-designed components. However, these approaches shared common limitations: they required extensive training data, complex model architectures, and significant expertise to implement and maintain.

The emergence of multimodal large language models (LLMs) represents a paradigm shift in document processing. These models combine advanced vision understanding with natural language processing capabilities, offering several groundbreaking advantages:

Minimized use of specialized computer vision architectures

Zero-shot capabilities without the need for supervised learning

Natural language interfaces for specifying location tasks

Flexible adaptation to different document types

This post demonstrates how to use foundation models (FMs) in Amazon Bedrock, specifically Amazon Nova Pro, to achieve high-accuracy document field localization while dramatically simplifying implementation. We show how these models can precisely locate and interpret document fields with minimal frontend effort, reducing processing errors and manual intervention. Through comprehensive benchmarking on the FATURA dataset, we provide benchmarking of performance and practical implementation guidance.

Understanding document information localization

Document information localization goes beyond traditional text extraction by identifying the precise spatial position of information within documents. Although OCR tells us what text exists, localization tells us where specific information resides—a crucial distinction for modern document processing workflows. This capability enables critical business operations ranging from automated quality checks and sensitive data redaction to intelligent document comparison and validation.

Traditional approaches to this challenge relied on a combination of rule-based systems and specialized computer vision models. These solutions often required extensive training data, careful template matching, and continuous maintenance to handle document variations. Financial institutions, for instance, would need separate models and rules for each type of invoice or form they processed, making scalability a significant challenge. Multimodal models with localization capabilities available on Amazon Bedrock fundamentally change this paradigm. Rather than requiring complex computer vision architectures or extensive training data, these multimodal LLMs can understand both the visual layout and semantic meaning of documents through natural language interactions. By using models with the capability to localize, organizations can implement robust document localization with significantly reduced technical overhead and greater adaptability to new document types.

Multimodal models with localization capabilities, such as those available on Amazon Bedrock, fundamentally change this paradigm.

By using models with the capability to localize, organizations can implement robust document localization with significantly reduced technical overhead and greater adaptability to new document types.

Solution overview

We designed a simple localization solution that takes a document image and text prompt as input, processes it through selected FMs on Amazon Bedrock, and returns the field locations using either absolute or normalized coordinates. The solution implements two distinct prompting strategies for document field localization:

Image dimension strategy – Works with absolute pixel coordinates, providing explicit image dimensions and requesting bounding box locations based on the document’s actual size

– Works with absolute pixel coordinates, providing explicit image dimensions and requesting bounding box locations based on the document’s actual size Scaled coordinate strategy – Uses a normalized 0–1000 coordinate system, making it more flexible across different document sizes and formats

The solution has a modular design to allow for straightforward extension to support custom field schemas through configuration updates rather than code changes. This flexibility, combined with the scalability of Amazon Bedrock, makes the solution suitable for both small-scale document processing and enterprise-wide deployment. In the following sections, we demonstrate the setup and implementation strategies used in our solution for document field localization using Amazon Bedrock FMs. You can see more details in our GitHub repository.

Prerequisites

For this walkthrough, you should have the following prerequisites:

An AWS account with Amazon Bedrock access

Permissions to use Amazon Nova Pro

Python 3.8+ with the boto3 library installed

Initial set ups

Complete the following setup steps:

Configure the Amazon Bedrock runtime client with appropriate retry logic and timeout settings:

import boto3 from botocore.config import Config # Configure Bedrock client with retry logic BEDROCK_CONFIG = Config( region_name='us-west-2', signature_version='v4', read_timeout=500, retries={ 'max_attempts': 10, 'mode': 'adaptive' } ) # Initialize Bedrock runtime client bedrock_runtime = boto3.client(""bedrock-runtime"", config=BEDROCK_CONFIG)

Define your field configuration to specify which elements to locate in your documents:

# sample config field_config = { ""invoice_number"": {""type"": ""string"", ""required"": True}, ""total_amount"": {""type"": ""currency"", ""required"": True}, ""date"": {""type"": ""date"", ""required"": True} }

Initialize the BoundingBoxExtractor with your chosen model and strategy:

extractor = BoundingBoxExtractor( model_id=NOVA_PRO_MODEL_ID, # or other FMs on Amazon Bedrock prompt_template_path=""path/to/prompt/template"", field_config=field_config, norm=None # Set to 1000 for scaled coordinate strategy ) # Process a document bboxes, metadata = extractor.get_bboxes( document_image=document_image, document_key=""invoice_001"" # Optional tracking key )

Implement prompting strategies

We test two prompt strategies in this workflow: image dimension and scaled coordinate.

The following is a sample prompt template for the image dimension strategy:

"""""" Your task is to detect and localize objects in images with high precision. Analyze each provided image (width = {w} pixels, height = {h} pixels) and return only a JSON object with bounding box data for detected objects. Output Requirements: 1. Use absolute pixel coordinates based on provided width and height. 2. Ensure high accuracy and tight-fitting bounding boxes. Detected Object Structure: - ""element"": Use one of these labels exactly: {elements} - ""bbox"": Array with coordinates [x1, y1, x2, y2] in absolute pixel values. JSON Structure: ```json {schema} ``` Provide only the specified JSON format without extra information. """"""

The following is a sample prompt template for the scaled coordinate strategy:

"""""" Your task is to detect and localize objects in images with high precision. Analyze each provided image and return only a JSON object with bounding box data for detected objects. Output Requirements: Use (x1, y1, x2, y2) format for bounding box coordinates, scaled between 0 and 1000. Detected Object Structure: - ""element"": Use one of these labels exactly: {elements} - ""bbox"": Array [x1, y1, x2, y2] scaled between 0 and 1000. JSON Structure: ```json {schema} ``` Provide only the specified JSON format without extra information. """"""

Evaluate performance

We implement evaluation metrics to monitor accuracy:

evaluator = BBoxEvaluator(field_config=field_config) evaluator.set_iou_threshold(0.5) # Adjust based on requirements evaluator.set_margin_percent(5) # Tolerance for position matching # Evaluate predictions results = evaluator.evaluate(predictions, ground_truth) print(f""Mean Average Precision: {results['mean_ap']:.4f}"")

This implementation provides a robust foundation for document field localization while maintaining flexibility for different use cases and document types. The choice between image dimension and scaled coordinate strategies depends on your specific accuracy requirements and document variation.

Benchmarking results

We conducted our benchmarking study using FATURA, a public invoice dataset specifically designed for document understanding tasks. The dataset comprises 10,000 single-page invoices saved as JPEG images, representing 50 distinct layout templates with 200 invoices per template. Each document is annotated with 24 key fields, including invoice numbers, dates, line items, and total amounts. The annotations provide both the text values and precise bounding box coordinates in JSON format, making it ideal for evaluating field localization tasks. The dataset has the following key characteristics:

Documents: 10,000 invoices (JPEG format)

Templates: 50 distinct layouts (200 documents each)

Fields per document: 24 annotated fields

Annotation format: JSON with bounding boxes and text values

Field types: Invoice numbers, dates, addresses, line items, amounts, taxes, totals

Image resolution: Standard A4 size at 300 DPI

Language: English

The following figure shows sample invoice templates showcasing layout variation.

The following figure is an example of annotation visualization.

Before conducting the full-scale benchmark, we performed an initial experiment to determine the optimal prompting strategy. We selected a representative subset of 50 images, comprising 5 samples from 10 different templates, and evaluated three distinct approaches:

Image dimension: Method: Provides explicit pixel dimensions and requests absolute coordinate bounding boxes Input: Image bytes, image dimensions, output schema

Scaled coordinate: Method: Uses normalized 0-1000 coordinate system Input: Image bytes, output schema

Added gridlines: Method: Enhances image with visual gridlines at fixed intervals Input: Modified image with gridlines bytes, image dimensions, output schema



The following figure compares performance for different approaches for Mean Average Precision (mAP).

Building on insights from our initial strategy evaluation, we conducted benchmarking using the complete FATURA dataset of 10,000 documents. We employed the scaled coordinate approach for Amazon Nova models, based on their respective optimal performance characteristics from our initial testing. Our evaluation framework assessed Amazon Nova Pro through standard metrics, including Intersection over Union (IoU) and Average Precision (AP). The evaluation spanned all 50 distinct invoice templates, using an IoU threshold of 0.5 and a 5% margin tolerance for field positioning.

The following figure is an example of successful localization for Amazon Nova Pro.

The results demonstrate Amazon Nova Pro’s strong performance in document field localization. Amazon Nova Pro achieved a mAP of 0.8305. It demonstrated consistent performance across various document layouts, achieving a mAP above 0.80 across 45 of 50 templates, with the lowest template-specific mAP being 0.665. Although Amazon Nova Pro showed relatively high processing failures (170 out of 10,000 images), it still maintained high overall performance. Most low AP results were attributed to either complete processing failures (particularly over-refusal by its guardrail filters and malformed JSON output) or field misclassifications (particularly confusion between similar fields, such as buyer vs. seller addresses).

The following table summarizes the overall performance metrics.

Mean IoU Mean AP Amazon Nova Pro 0.7423 0.8331

The following graph shows the performance distribution for each individual extraction of approximately 20 labels for 10,000 documents.

Field-specific analysis reveals that Amazon Nova Pro excels at locating structured fields like invoice numbers and dates, consistently achieving precision and recall scores above 0.85. It demonstrates particularly strong performance with text fields, maintaining robust accuracy even when dealing with varying currency formats and decimal representations. This resilience to format variations makes it especially valuable for processing documents from multiple sources or regions.

The following graph summarizes field-specific performance. The graph shows AP success percentage for each label, across all documents for each model. It is sorted by highest success.

Conclusion

This benchmarking study demonstrates the significant advances in document field localization by multimodal FMs. Through comprehensive testing on the FATURA dataset, we’ve shown that these models can effectively locate and extract document fields with minimal setup effort, dramatically simplifying traditional computer vision workflows. Amazon Nova Pro emerges as an excellent choice for enterprise document processing, delivering a mAP of 0.8305 with consistent performance across diverse document types. Looking ahead, we see several promising directions for further optimization. Future work could explore extending the solution in agentic workflows to support more complex document types and field relationships.

https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/08/18/prediction-these-3-artificial-intelligence-ai-stoc/,"Ten years. $10 trillion. Easy peasy?

It took over 400 years from the time the first stock was traded until a stock reached a market cap of $1 trillion. And that stock, PetroChina, soon fell below the magic level, causing investors to wait more than a decade for a stock to hit $1 trillion and remain above the threshold.

However, I don't think it will take nearly as long for multiple stocks to break another important barrier. I predict that the following three artificial intelligence (AI) stocks will be worth over $10 trillion by 2035.

1. Nvidia

Nvidia (NVDA 1.65%) is the easiest pick with my prediction. The company's valuation already hovers close to $4.5 trillion. Nvidia would only need to grow by around 8.3% per year for its market cap to hit $10 trillion by 2035. I think that growth level is readily attainable.

Two things need to happen for Nvidia to deliver average annual growth of at least 8.3% over the next 10 years. First, the demand for AI chips must continue to increase robustly. Second, Nvidia's GPUs must remain the best in the business for building and deploying AI models.

I'm confident that the demand for AI chips will grow for years to come. Like many others, I believe we're only in the early days of AI adoption. If significant progress is made in building artificial general intelligence (AI) systems, the growth in demand for AI chips could be explosive.

Will Nvidia's GPUs remain the gold standard for AI applications? My hunch is that they will. Sure, Nvidia has several formidable challengers. However, the company continues to invest heavily in research and development and has a rapid cadence of launching new innovations. I expect Nvidia will stay on top.

2. Apple

Apple (AAPL 1.21%) became the first stock to sustain a market cap of over $1 trillion. I believe it will be among the elite group of stocks worth $10 trillion or more by 2035. To accomplish this, Apple would need to nearly triple its current market cap of around $3.4 trillion. Is that doable? Yes, if the company can deliver a compound annual growth rate of 11.4%.

The good news is that Apple is already achieving the earnings growth needed. The company's earnings per share jumped 12% in its latest quarter. The better news is that Apple could have catalysts on the way that accelerate its growth.

Rumors are rampant that Apple plans to launch a foldable iPhone next year. Bloomberg recently reported that the company will introduce a countertop robot in 2027. These AI companions would incorporate a turbocharged and more visual version of Apple's Siri AI assistant.

Perhaps the most important new growth driver for Apple, though, could be AI glasses. The first version of the new device could come as soon as 2026 and compete against Meta Platforms' popular smart glasses.

3. Alphabet

I predict Alphabet (GOOG 2.98%) (GOOGL 3.10%) will join Nvidia and Apple in the $10 trillion club. The Google parent's market cap currently stands at roughly $2.5 trillion. Its stock would need to quadruple by 2035 to hit $10 trillion. That translates to an annual growth rate of nearly 15%.

Alphabet is already delivering earnings growth that tops the required level. Current revenue growth falls just short, but a modest uptick would close the gap. I think there are several ways the company could squeeze out a little more growth.

Probably the simplest way for Alphabet to reach a market cap of $10 trillion is for Google Cloud to gain even more momentum. Google Cloud is the fastest-growing major cloud service provider right now. I can envision its growth accelerating with the launch of highly capable AI agents that perform a wide variety of tasks for users.

But Alphabet has multiple other alternative growth drivers. Waymo is poised to be a big winner in the robotaxi market over the next few years. Don't be surprised if Google becomes a major player in the AI glasses market, along with Apple and Meta. It could even make a huge breakthrough in quantum computing that helps boost Alphabet's market cap to the $10 trillion mark.

Could there be more?

While I'm predicting that Nvidia, Apple, and Alphabet will have market caps of at least $10 trillion by 2035, I'm not saying there won't be other AI stocks in the club. Microsoft is an obvious candidate. So is Amazon. I wouldn't be surprised if Meta is in the group as well, although it's somewhat more of a dark horse.","Sentiment score 0.10000000149011612 , Sentiment Magnitude 18.5","name:Nvidia type: 3 Salience 0.11133415251970291, name:Apple type: 3 Salience 0.05448261275887489, name:investors type: 1 Salience 0.013019390404224396, name:company type: 3 Salience 0.012925532646477222, name:AI companions type: 3 Salience 0.009357066825032234, name:growth type: 4 Salience 0.009069488383829594, name:PetroChina type: 3 Salience 0.0077017322182655334, name:pick type: 4 Salience 0.00625241594389081, name:AI type: 3 Salience 0.005804515443742275, name:glasses type: 6 Salience 0.004636285360902548, name:version type: 5 Salience 0.004495541099458933, name:growth driver type: 1 Salience 0.004228671081364155, name:GPUs type: 3 Salience 0.00403194036334753, name:group type: 3 Salience 0.003753156401216984, name:models type: 6 Salience 0.0032786850351840258, name:others type: 1 Salience 0.003273935755714774, name:challengers type: 1 Salience 0.0032658600248396397, name:assistant type: 1 Salience 0.0030140322633087635, name:device type: 6 Salience 0.003012079978361726, name:cloud service provider type: 3 Salience 0.002894024131819606","Category:/Business & Industrial , Category_confidence:78.0%"

https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/08/16/2-artificial-intelligence-ai-stocks-the-us-governm/,"The U.S. government is investing heavily in AI technology, particularly in software.

When it comes to artificial intelligence (AI) stocks, chances are investors' thoughts may turn to semiconductors, massive data centers, or cloud computing infrastructure. This is great news for chip powerhouses and hyperscalers like Nvidia, Advanced Micro Devices, Broadcom, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing, Microsoft, Amazon, or Alphabet, but investors could be overlooking emerging opportunities beyond the usual suspects.

Enterprise-grade software will become an increasingly vital layer atop the hardware stack. The commercial angle is to market AI-powered software to large corporations with complex needs spanning data analytics, logistics, human resources, cybersecurity, and more.

But there is another opportunity outside of the private sector: how AI is redefining one of the largest and most sophisticated enterprises of all, the U.S. government. Earlier this year, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth announced a plan to allocate more spending toward the Software Acquisition Pathway (SWP), a strategy first deployed in 2020. Its stated aim is to ""provide for the efficient and effective acquisition, development, integration, and timely delivery of secure software.""

Let's explore how Palantir Technologies (PLTR 1.60%) and BigBear.ai (BBAI -0.09%) are capitalizing on AI's shift from hardware to software and how each company is approaching the opportunity with SWP.

1. Palantir Technologies: The AI darling of the U.S. government

Palantir has been at the center of several notable deals with the federal government throughout 2025. In late May, it deepened its relationship with the Department of Defense (DOD) through a $795 million extension featuring its Maven Smart System (MSS). This brought the total value of the MSS program to $1.28 billion, making it a long-term revenue driver. More recently, the company won a deal with the Army reportedly worth up to $10 billion over the next 10 years.

Palantir's wins extend beyond the U.S. military as well. The company is building the Immigration Lifecycle Operating System -- often referred to as ImmigrationOS -- for Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE).

Signing multiyear billion-dollar deals provides Palantir with high revenue visibility, keeps its customer base sticky, and opens the door to upsell or cross-sell added services down the road.

The ability to parlay its defense expertise into other government functions also expands Palantir's public sector footprint and reinforces the breadth of its capabilities -- solidifying its role as a ubiquitous AI backbone for the U.S. government.

2. BigBear.ai: A niche player helping the public sector

Another AI software developer that has signed deals with the U.S. government this year is BigBear.ai. In February, it won a contract with the DOD to design a system to assist national security decision-making by analyzing trends and patterns in foreign media.

Shortly thereafter, the company won a $13.2 million deal spread over three and a half years to support the Joint Chiefs of Staff's force management and data analytics capabilities.

In May, the company partnered with Hardy Dynamics to advance the Army's use of machine learning and AI for autonomous drones.

Lastly, BigBear.ai has a deal with U.S. Customs and Border Protection to deploy its biometric AI infrastructure system, called Pangiam, at a dozen major airports across North America to help streamline arrivals and improve security protocols.

Which is the better stock: Palantir or BigBear.ai?

Between the two stocks, I see Palantir as the clear choice. BigBear.ai has proved it can win meaningful government contracts, but its work is more niche-focused and smaller in scale compared to Palantir's multibillion-dollar deals across multiple platforms.

In my view, BigBear.ai's popularity is largely with retail investors who are hoping that it becomes the ""next Palantir."" Smart investors know that hope is not a real strategy. Prudent valuation analysis -- and not speculation -- is required to know which stock is truly worth buying.

While some on Wall Street may argue that Palantir stock is cheap based on software-specific metrics such as the Rule of 40, I'm not entirely bought into such a narrative.

Traditional approaches to valuation, such as the price-to-sales ratio (P/S), show that Palantir is the priciest software-as-a-service stock among the businesses in the chart above -- and its valuation expansion means that shares are becoming even more expensive as the stock continues to rally.

Palantir is an impressive company that has proved it can deliver on crucial applications, but the stock is historically expensive. I think that investors are better off waiting for a more reasonable entry point and paying a more appropriate price down the road.","Sentiment score 0.0 , Sentiment Magnitude 9.399999618530273","name:government type: 3 Salience 0.14311707019805908, name:AI type: 3 Salience 0.10051080584526062, name:Palantir Technologies type: 3 Salience 0.051741547882556915, name:U.S. type: 2 Salience 0.04545774310827255, name:software type: 6 Salience 0.025447530671954155, name:Enterprise-grade software type: 6 Salience 0.012159808538854122, name:investors type: 1 Salience 0.010420465841889381, name:semiconductors type: 6 Salience 0.008352896198630333, name:data centers type: 2 Salience 0.008352896198630333, name:company type: 3 Salience 0.00833949539810419, name:hyperscalers type: 1 Salience 0.007302212528884411, name:suspects type: 1 Salience 0.007302212528884411, name:Microsoft type: 3 Salience 0.004916307982057333, name:Amazon type: 3 Salience 0.004318634048104286, name:Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing type: 3 Salience 0.004318634048104286, name:Nvidia type: 3 Salience 0.004318634048104286, name:Advanced Micro Devices type: 3 Salience 0.004318634048104286, name:Broadcom type: 3 Salience 0.004318634048104286, name:Pete Hegseth type: 1 Salience 0.0041968063451349735, name:enterprises type: 3 Salience 0.0031206661369651556","Category:/Business & Industrial , Category_confidence:60.0%"
https://www.npr.org/2025/08/22/nx-s1-5510058/housing-market-mortgage-rates-homebuilding,"Home sales are ticking up — and more are coming to market

toggle caption Joe Raedle/Getty Images

After mortgage rates shot up three years ago, the housing market slowed. And the newest numbers from the National Association of Realtors (NAR) show only a glint of improvement: Sales of existing homes rose 2% in July, compared to a month earlier.

At the current pace, the association estimates that about 4 million existing homes will be sold in the U.S. this year. That's far lower than during the pandemic and significantly lower than before the pandemic.

But there is a bright spot or two in the new figures. First, a lot more homes are for sale. ""We now have the highest inventory since the 2020 lockdown period, essentially five years ago,"" said Lawrence Yun, the association's chief economist.

Sponsor Message

In July there were 1.55 million units for sale, nearly 16% more than a year earlier.

The increase in inventory is good news for buyers, because it gives them options and more leverage to negotiate. (For sellers, it's not so good. Homes are taking longer to sell — an average of 28 days, compared to 24 days in July 2024, according to the NAR.)

Also, prices are softening in many markets: A report by Realtor.com found that prices in July dropped in 33 of the 50 largest metro areas. NAR's data showed price declines in the South and West, and home prices are now increasing at their slowest pace in two years, according to an analysis by Wells Fargo.

Still, nationwide, prices were up — although minimally — to a median price of $422,400.

High prices deter buyers, but more listings help

The market is slow because prices and mortgage rates are high.

Rates for a 30-year mortgage are currently averaging about 6.6%. And home prices have risen a lot — nearly 50% since before the pandemic. Put those together, and it means that many people who want to buy a home simply can't afford to.

Still, even a small shift in mortgage rates is enough to help loosen things up slightly. Mortgage rates have inched down in recent weeks and are now at their lowest level since October 2024.

Sponsor Message

That has spurred a jump in refinance activity, especially among homeowners with mortgage rates above 7%. It's offered them a window to get a lower rate and shave potentially hundreds of dollars off their monthly payments.

In the months ahead, Joel Kan, deputy chief economist at the Mortgage Bankers Association, says some ""opposing forces"" will affect mortgage rates.

""Our forecast is for rates to stay close to the 6.6% range, at least through the end of the year,"" he said. But the Federal Reserve Board meets in mid-September for a vote on whether to lower interest rates, which can influence mortgage rates. ""You certainly have the expectation that if the Fed does start to cut rates, rates might come down,"" he continued. ""On the other side, you do have things like concerns around the debt and the deficit of the U.S. that is keeping rates higher.""

And to make things even more complicated, Kan says, it's likely that anticipation of a possible interest rate cut is already being factored into current mortgage rates, which means a cut might not cause mortgage rates to drop further.

Still, Kan expects some change next year, when he thinks rates could get down to the 6.5% range, with weeks where they dip below that mark. Lower rates could push some would-be buyers off the sidelines, because they'll help make the homebuying math work — as long as prices don't spike.

The lock-in effect is easing a bit

During the pandemic, many homeowners were able to buy or refinance at super-low mortgage rates in the 3% range. Today, those low rates give them a strong incentive to stay put, since moving would mean taking on a higher-priced loan.

That's left many U.S. households stuck in homes that are too small or too large — and unable to trade for a better fit. Economists have worried that this ""lock-in effect"" would keep the housing market stuck for many years.

The rising inventory level reported by the NAR this week is a sign that some people are moving out and giving up those low rates.

""We are still below pre-COVID [levels], but certainly we are no longer in that mortgage rate lock-in period. As people need to move, people are putting their homes on the market and making the next moves,"" says Yun. ""The turnover in the home sales market still remains very very sluggish, but the inventory is beginning to show up.""

Mixed indicators on new home construction

New data this week from the Census Bureau shows that housing starts in July were up 5% over a month earlier. But building permits were down nearly 3% compared to June.

Buddy Hughes, chairman of the National Association of Home Builders, said in a statement that reductions in homebuilding are the result of affordability challenges for buyers, a shortage of skilled labor and high regulatory costs.

""These headwinds were reflected in our latest builder survey, which indicates that affordability is the top challenge to the housing market,"" Hughes added.","Sentiment score -0.10000000149011612 , Sentiment Magnitude 18.5","name:National Association of Realtors type: 3 Salience 0.0356876365840435, name:homes type: 2 Salience 0.024814175441861153, name:Joel Kan type: 1 Salience 0.02070048451423645, name:Lawrence Yun type: 1 Salience 0.02053075283765793, name:pandemic type: 4 Salience 0.012890171259641647, name:association type: 3 Salience 0.01265927404165268, name:buyers type: 1 Salience 0.012500621378421783, name:toggle caption type: 1 Salience 0.009752868674695492, name:people type: 1 Salience 0.00942794419825077, name:U.S. type: 2 Salience 0.009417708963155746, name:hundreds type: 1 Salience 0.006235096137970686, name:Joe Raedle type: 1 Salience 0.005768575239926577, name:Getty Images type: 3 Salience 0.005768575239926577, name:home type: 2 Salience 0.005455836653709412, name:report type: 5 Salience 0.005146615207195282, name:homeowners type: 1 Salience 0.004934509750455618, name:Buddy Hughes type: 1 Salience 0.0038801105692982674, name:sellers type: 1 Salience 0.0036088109482079744, name:Federal Reserve Board type: 3 Salience 0.0035834561567753553, name:areas type: 2 Salience 0.0024298285134136677","Category:/News/Business News , Category_confidence:77.0%"

The gig economy, also known as the sharing or access economy, features temporary, freelance, and part-time positions often filled by independent contractors. While offering flexibility and independence to workers, it removes job security and benefits like health insurance and paid leave. Companies save costs by hiring freelancers without these benefits.



Key Takeaways A gig economy is characterized by temporary, contract, and freelance jobs rather than permanent positions.

Gig workers enjoy flexibility but often lack job security and essential benefits such as health insurance.

Employers benefit by saving costs and hiring from a larger, globally accessible talent pool.

The gig economy surged during the COVID-19 pandemic, with 64 million Americans participating by 2023.

Potential downsides include disrupted work-life balance, financial insecurity for workers, and limited career development.

Types of Gig Economy Jobs

The gig economy is a labor market characterized by temporary, contract, and freelance jobs rather than permanent positions. People earn money from providing on-demand work, services, or goods.

Gig work includes managing rentals, tutoring, coding, driving for ride-share services, delivering food, or writing articles. Colleges also hire adjunct and part-time professors to save costs and fulfill academic needs.

The gig economy experienced significant increases in 2020. COVID-19 lockdowns forced people to work from home and rely more on purchasing goods and services online, and these trends continued when restrictions were lifted. In 2023, nearly 64 million Americans, 38% of the U.S. workforce, were freelancers or gig workers, according to an Upwork report. Independent contract workers contributed $1.27 trillion to the U.S. economy.

Fast Fact The term ""gig economy"" comes from the music industry, where artists book short-term gigs at different venues.

Advantages of the Gig Economy for Employers and Workers

For Employers Wider range of applicants due to remote work options

Can hire and fire more easily based on seasonal work

Do not need to provide costly benefits like health insurance or paid vacation time For Employees Greater flexibility for individuals to set their own schedule

Offers various side-hustle opportunities to those who work regular full-time jobs

Remote positions allow gig workers to live anywhere that has an internet connection

Important Hiring full-time employees costs employers 1.25 to 1.4 times their salary, so a $35,000 salary can cost $43,750 to $49,000.

Challenges and Risks in the Gig Economy

The rise of the gig economy can hinder full-time employees from building careers and long-term reputations. It also often erodes worker rights, like health insurance and paid leave.

Employers feel less pressure to raise wages, as they can hire people worldwide, including areas with lower living costs.

The flexibility of working gigs can disrupt the work-life balance, sleep patterns, and daily life. Long-term relationships between workers, employers, clients, and vendors can erode. This can eliminate the benefits of building long-term trust, customary practice, and familiarity with clients and employers.

Do Gig Workers Experience Higher Job Satisfaction Than Regular Employees? According to the National Institute of Health, gig workers reported lower mental health and life satisfaction than those employed full-time and part-time in 2022. Gig workers also experienced higher levels of loneliness and financial insecurity.

How Do Gig Workers Get Health Benefits? As independent contractors, gig workers must pay for health insurance benefits and expenses. They are also responsible for self-employment taxes and business expenses.

How Do Gig Workers Pay Taxes? Individuals must report any income made in cash, property, goods, or virtual currency, earned from the gig economy on a tax return. This includes part-time, temporary, or income not reported on another form like Form 1099-K, 1099-MISC, 1099-NEC, or W-2.



Conclusion: Navigating the Gig Economy

The gig economy thrives on flexible, temporary, and freelance jobs, benefiting employers by reducing costs like health benefits and paid vacation. For gig workers, this setup offers scheduling freedom and diverse income opportunities, but it also requires them to manage their own benefits and financial responsibilities, such as taxes. As the gig economy expands, understanding its pros and cons empowers individuals and businesses to make informed decisions about participation.","Sentiment score 0.0 , Sentiment Magnitude 14.100000381469727","name:contractors type: 3 Salience 0.02877798117697239, name:Gig workers type: 1 Salience 0.021108439192175865, name:workers type: 1 Salience 0.01587732695043087, name:employees type: 1 Salience 0.007897189818322659, name:Employers type: 3 Salience 0.003383178496733308, name:Companies type: 3 Salience 0.007166016846895218, name:People type: 1 Salience 0.0069855754263699055, name:contract workers type: 1 Salience 0.005894943606108427, name:gig workers type: 1 Salience 0.005712719634175301, name:individuals type: 1 Salience 0.005568312481045723, name:Americans type: 1 Salience 0.004691616632044315, name:workforce type: 1 Salience 0.003980718553066254, name:employers type: 3 Salience 0.003095917869359255, name:pandemic type: 4 Salience 0.0026902970857918262, name:articles type: 5 Salience 0.0025628816802054644, name:people type: 1 Salience 0.0022459402680397034, name:artists type: 1 Salience 0.0021738363429903984, name:Gig Economy for Employers type: 3 Salience 0.002168429782614112, name:U.S. type: 2 Salience 0.0018358025699853897, name:venues type: 2 Salience 0.001817604061216116","Category:/Business & Industrial , Category_confidence:68.0%"

https://www.usbank.com/investing/financial-perspectives/market-news/chinas-economic-influence.html,"China remains among the largest global economies, but it faces significant economic headwinds. The country’s real gross domestic product (GDP) growth, a common economic activity measure, slowed from double-digit annual increases during the 2000s to 5.3% in this year’s second quarter. Nevertheless, China remains a major global trading partner and ranks as the second-largest economy worldwide, trailing only the United States. 1

President Donald Trump’s agenda emphasizes reframing Chinese trade relations. To reduce dependence on Chinese-made goods and promote domestic manufacturing, President Trump implemented varying tariffs on Chinese imports. Early in the new administration, the U.S. added 10% tariffs to China. That quickly doubled to 20% and eventually totaled 145%, threatening to cripple trade activity.

On May 11, 2025, the United States and China announced a 90-day agreement reducing U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods to 30%. This agreement was recently extended for an additional 90 days through November 10. During negotiations, China reduced tariffs on imported U.S. goods to 10%, from the previous 125%.","Sentiment score -0.10000000149011612 , Sentiment Magnitude 2.4000000953674316","name:China type: 2 Salience 0.09701699018478394, name:United States type: 3 Salience 0.0016610085731372237, name:country type: 2 Salience 0.046410683542490005, name:Donald Trump type: 1 Salience 0.031201446428894997, name:President type: 1 Salience 0.013614503666758537, name:manufacturing type: 4 Salience 0.011963864788413048, name:trading partner type: 3 Salience 0.011918927542865276, name:administration type: 3 Salience 0.010958756320178509, name:goods type: 6 Salience 0.010277679190039635, name:negotiations type: 4 Salience 0.005754384212195873","Category:/Business & Industrial , Category_confidence:73.0%"

Nvidia and Taiwan Semiconductor are slated to profit from the huge AI computing power buildout.

Meta Platforms and Alphabet are using AI to improve advertising.

Amazon's cloud computing division is seeing strong AI demand.

10 stocks we like better than Nvidia ›

The best investing strategies involve buying great companies and holding them over long periods to let them be, which has yielded impressive returns if you picked the right businesses.

Among the top performers over the past decade have been Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA), Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE: TSM), Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN), Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META), and Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL). I removed Nvidia from the chart below because it's up over 30,000% in the past decade, which skews the graph, but the other four have also done phenomenally well.

The ""worst"" performer of the remaining four has been Alphabet, with its stock rising nearly five times in value.

These five stocks have had a strong run over the past decade, but I still believe they are excellent picks for the next decade, mainly due to the proliferation of artificial intelligence (AI). They are at the top of my list right now, and I think buying shares with the mindset of holding for the next decade is a wise investment strategy.

Nvidia and Taiwan Semiconductor are providing AI computing power

All five of these stocks are benefiting in various ways from the AI race.

Nvidia makes graphics processing units (GPUs), which are currently the most popular computing hardware for running and training AI models. It owns this market, and its dominance has allowed it to become the world's largest company.

There's still a huge AI computing demand that hasn't been met, which bodes well for Nvidia's future. Because of this, it remains one of the best stocks to buy and hold over the next decade.

Taiwan Semiconductor (TSMC for short) is a manufacturer that produces chips for many of the major players in AI, including Nvidia. These companies don't have chip production capabilities, so they farm that work out to TSMC, which has earned its reputation for being the best foundry in the world through continuous innovation and impressive yields. There are few challengers to its supremacy, and this position will help it continue to be a market-crushing stock for the foreseeable future.

Nvidia and Taiwan Semiconductor are seeing huge growth right now because they're providing the computing power necessary for AI. The next three are also benefiting and will likely see even more success over the next decade.","Sentiment score 0.4000000059604645 , Sentiment Magnitude 11.5","name:Nvidia type: 3 Salience 0.2194463461637497, name:companies type: 3 Salience 0.1348337084054947, name:Taiwan Semiconductor type: 3 Salience 0.07076231390237808, name:Meta Platforms type: 3 Salience 0.019004585221409798, name:NASDAQ type: 3 Salience 0.013994690030813217, name:cloud computing division type: 3 Salience 0.010438305325806141, name:Amazon type: 3 Salience 0.009199890308082104, name:Alphabet type: 3 Salience 0.007346047554165125, name:AI type: 3 Salience 0.006316981744021177, name:four type: 1 Salience 0.005240187048912048, name:performer type: 1 Salience 0.004742693621665239, name:farm type: 2 Salience 0.004676193930208683, name:performers type: 1 Salience 0.0044738175347447395, name:businesses type: 3 Salience 0.003937495872378349, name:challengers type: 1 Salience 0.0035659444984048605, name:run type: 4 Salience 0.0026724901981651783, name:race type: 4 Salience 0.002441840711981058, name:NYSE type: 3 Salience 0.0023233266547322273, name:AMZN type: 3 Salience 0.0023233266547322273, name:world type: 2 Salience 0.0020856386981904507","Category:/Computers & Electronics/Computer Hardware/Computer Components , Category_confidence:80.0%"
https://insights.som.yale.edu/insights/magas-march-toward-command-economy,"This commentary originally appeared in Fortune. The views expressed are the author’s own.

As many CEOs understandably grew horrified last month at the prospect that New York City, the capital of capitalism, is on the brink of going socialist with the mayoral momentum of the inexperienced candidate Zohran Mamdani, they were ignoring the greater assault on free market capitalism that has already overtaken the nation in the Republican Party. While we agree that Mamdani’s solutions to affordable housing and grocery prices threaten to undermine free markets by bowing to the appeal of populist anger, President Donald Trump has already begun doing so, but to suit his own grandiose political agenda instead.

Unlike any leader of any free-market economy around the world, President Trump has seized control of private enterprise’s strategic decision-making and investment policies while invading corporate board rooms so that he may dictate leadership staffing, punish corporate critics, and demand public compliance with his political agenda. This is far more dangerous to capitalism than a city-run grocery store.

Many free-market economists and business leaders who have long worshipped the free-market ideals of Adam Smith, Friedrich Hayek, Ayn Rand, and Milton Friedman should be aware that their idols would be rolling in their graves right now, as rather than pursue standard laissez-faire conservative economic policies, MAGA has gone Marxist and even, increasingly, Maoist.

As Greg Ip warned this week in The Wall Street Journal, “The US marches toward state capitalism with American characteristics … President Trump is imitating [the] Chinese Communist Party by extending political control ever deeper into the economy.” Ip pointed out that in the past, crisis-driven government bailouts of the banking and automotive sectors, such as TARP, were acute, targeted assistance, with brief and bipartisan rescue aims. Similarly, government incentives to drive investments in chips manufacturing, oil exploration, space exploration, internet development, agricultural vitality, cancer detection, disease treatment, and clean energy were not ownership deals with preferred companies or corporate cronies.

Indeed, Ip’s warnings mirror our own, as we were the first to accurately, presciently warn—over a year ago—that many of Trump’s economic positions more closely resemble communism than capitalism, as part of what we called “the coming MAGA assault on capitalism.” It certainly looks like MAGA is going Marxist if not even Maoist, especially across Trump’s vicious personal targeting of individual business leaders; government crackdown on business freedom of expression; weaponization of government powers; apparent extortion of businesses; and insertion of government into an unprecedented, outsized role in private sector strategic investment, capital flows and business decision-making.

Marxism and Maoism were both, of course, expressions of the communist theory that spilled forth from Karl Marx’s pen in the 19th century, brought to life in the brutal one-party states of the Soviet Union and the People’s Republic of China under its leader Mao Zedong, before it evolved into “capitalism with Chinese characteristics” starting in the 1970s, around the time of President Richard Nixon’s fateful visit to Beijing.

Both Marxism and Maoism claimed to champion “ordinary people” against corrupt or exploitative elites, while both targeted intellectuals, bureaucrats, and traditionalists, and purged institutions to enforce ideological purity, especially during Stalin’s “Great Terror” and Mao’s “Cultural Revolution.” Both centralized leadership to the point of creating a cult of personality, demanding intense loyalty and the glorification of the sole figure who could fix the country’s problems. Both prized loyalty over expertise, sidelining critics and dissenters in favor of a tightly controlled political narrative. Sound familiar?

The essence of market capitalism is that owners—shareholders and the management they appoint share in the profits. These deals give share of profits to government in return for favors. Friedman said that federal government should never own anything—that it should not run a surplus because it would have funds to invest in the private sector. What strategic decision-making rights would the government have in such deals, then?

Assaults targeting individual business leaders

Trump has a long history of targeting individual CEOs in highly vicious, personal terms for perceived offenses. This week, Trump called for the firing of Goldman Sachs’ renowned economist Jan Hatzius who accurately called the 2008 financial crisis over the economist’s concern regarding the tariff overhand on the US economy. He also attacked a top-performing financier, David Solomon, the non-partisan CEO of Goldman Sachs, telling him to quit and just be a disc jockey. (Solomon has a famous side hustle as an electronic dance music DJ, known as DJ D-Sol.)

Just last week, many semiconductor industry observers expressed tremendous discomfort with Trump’s attacks on Lip-Bu Tan, the CEO of Intel, and Trump’s calls for his immediate resignation. Even those who are genuinely concerned by Tan’s documented history of CCP ties and his continuing investments in China, would have preferred that Trump express his views in a more subtle fashion which recognizes the widespread entanglements of the Chinese Communist Party in the largest Chinese businesses. Roughly one-third of the Chinese economy is controlled by CCP-owned enterprises with actual CCP monitors in their boardrooms. Instead of calling this out, the Trump administration appears to want to match such corporate oversight itself.

Virtually any CEO doing business in China works with companies and schools that have ties to People’s Liberation Army of China, given China’s own authoritarian command economy. There has been great concern that such prominent Chinese businesses as Huawei, Aviation Industry Corporation of China (AVIC), China Telecom, China Mobile, and Hikvision have close ties to the PLA. Many state-owned enterprises with which most western enterprises do business even have militias with ties to the PLA. While this is concerning across political parties, how can President Trump justifying singling out Intel alone?

Trump has similarly publicly called out and humiliated leading CEOs ranging from Jamie Dimon of JPMorgan to Brian Moynihan of Bank of America to Doug McMillon of Walmart to Tim Cook of Apple to Matt Levatich of Harley-Davidson, among many others, when they speak the truth about issues ranging from trade policies to HR practices to diplomacy to environmental sustainability.

The unwarranted attack on Brian Moynihan and Bank of America—that they previously denied him as a customer—was particularly alarming as President Trump’s four bankruptcies were reasonable concerns when major banks were approached about lending to him. Bewilderingly, Deutsche Bank’s private wealth unit loaned Trump $48 million—following his default on a $640 million loan from Deutsche Bank’s commercial unit. Now regulators are being told by the Trump Administration to withdraw reputation risk as criteria for reviewing prudent banking practices.

Suppressing business freedom of expression in favor of political obedience

The political right used to complain about the “political correctness of the left.” Similarly, Trump’s history of cracking down on businesses for exercising their freedom of expression resembles the purges of Maoist China far more than American democratic norms.

For example, when Merck CEO Ken Frazier resigned from Trump’s Manufacturing Councils in protest over Trump’s infamous response to the Charlottesville rally, claiming there were “fine people” on both sides, Trump lashed out at Frazier, mocking him by saying he’d now have “more time to lower ripoff drug prices.” Similarly, Trump has repeatedly attacked Jeff Bezos, claiming that Amazon was “stealing” from the U.S. Postal Service in the aftermath of critical coverage by the Bezos-owned Washington Post.

Trump FTC Chairman Andrew Ferguson has publicly challenged woke ideology as a part of his antitrust remit, arguing that “In 2020, if you had a view on masks that was inconsistent with how big tech felt about masks, you weren’t allowed to talk about it. If you had a view on vaccines, couldn’t talk about it. But it wasn’t just big tech censorship. That was a huge problem. Consumers couldn’t go into a store without having political messages pushed in their face. And I’m sitting in 2020 working in the Senate going, gosh, if companies feel like they can alienate half their consumer base without suffering any real competitive consequences, we probably have a competition problem.”

Similarly, Trump FCC Chair Brendan Carr has argued that he would use DEI as a basis to block mergers, declaring that “if there are businesses out there that are still promoting invidious forms of DEI discrimination, I really don’t see a path forward where the FCC could reach the conclusion that approving the transaction is going to be in the public interest.”

Accordingly, to complete it acquisition of Paramount/CBS, David Ellison’s Skydance had to ensure review of its news reporting “to address bias and restore fact-based reporting” with a bias monitor as well as racial hiring practices which met the FCC’s standards under Carr.

Seizing control of strategic investment and private enterprise decision-making

Akin to Mao Zedong directing business decisions as a part of his wildly disastrous Great Leap Forward central economic planning initiative, Trump has plunged the US government headfirst into an unprecedented active role in directing private business decision-making and capital flows. Last month, he ordered Coca-Cola CEO James Quincey to replace cane sugar with other sweeteners that the firm uses, despite the lack of scientific evidence supporting such a move and despite the fact that the CEO of Coca-Cola is accountable to his board and shareholders, not Donald Trump.

This even extends to the US government directly receiving equity stakes, golden shares, and royalties from business revenues, sometimes as a part of complicated negotiations with the US government and giving off the appearance, whether warranted or not, of drug deals. For example, leading chipmakers Nvidia and AMD were just forced to surrender 15% of the revenue flows from their sales to China to the U.S. government, apparently as a concession to be able to continue selling in that market.

Similarly, as a precondition to approving the dangerous takeover of US Steel by the Japanese, Trump extracted a “golden share” for the U.S. government with effective veto power over certain corporate decisions. Likewise, in his first term, Trump attacked Harley-Davidson for supposedly moving factories overseas when in reality 100% of its beloved motorcycles sold in the U.S. are actually made in the U.S. Out of sheer political spite, Trump proclaimed that American bikers should buy from Harley’s foreign competitors, ranting that Harley had “surrendered” and “betrayed” America while threatening “they will be taxed like never before.”

Likewise, Trump wrongly accused Ford of robbing Detroit of jobs when it relocated an engine plant from Europe to Mexico, fortifying its North American supply chain. When one of us personally corrected Trump on that, he replied, “I don’t care, it’s working.” At the same time, the home appliances firm Carrier had a parallel experience with Trump-bashing them, despite being located in Mike Pence’s home state of Indiana.

Political weaponization of government powers

Trump targeted AT&T with a drawn-out antitrust suit as well as numerous personal taunts when it tried to merge with Time Warner, hoping to pressure CNN to become more friendly in its coverage. In stark contrast, Trump pal Rupert Murdoch received the white-gloves treatment through antitrust when he sold 21st Century Fox at around the same time, despite arguably more genuine antitrust concerns.

In fact, Trump antitrust chief Makan Delrahim expressed support for the AT&T-Time Warner combination as an academic but flipped 180 degrees to appease Trump once in office, holding up the deal for two years. Likewise, before his first term ran out, Trump personally drove a proposed deal that would have secured TikTok for his longtime supporter and friend Larry Ellison at Oracle, unusually inserting himself into every detail of the negotiation process.

The appearance of extortion and bribery

As prominent media commentators such as Oliver Darcy and Matt Belloni point out, some of Trump’s demands resemble extortion. There was the payment of $16 million to the Trump Presidential Library from CBS News’ 60 Minutes over the standard editing of an interview with Kamala Harris last summer. This occurred over the objections of its executive producer (who resigned in protest), and while FCC approval was pending of Paramount’s acquisition by Skydance.

This was followed by the cancellation of the modern “King of Comedy,” Stephen Colbert, whose revered late show suddenly had its deal abruptly canceled on the eve of Trump’s FCC merger approval, seemingly over its satirical criticism of the Trump administration. The explanation that the show was too expensive and lost money raised many eyebrows, particularly given the lack of attempts to trim the 200-person production staff.

Similar lawsuits initiated by Trump in office against private businesses give off a similar appearance of extortion and bribery, whether justified or not. These include Trump’s $10 billion lawsuit against The Wall Street Journal for reporting about a letter Trump wrote to Jeffrey Epstein for his 50th birthday; and Disney/ABC’s $15 million payment to the Trump Presidential Library to settle defamation claims against George Stephanopoulos.

Across each of these five dimensions, one can’t help but think MAGA is going Marxist or full Maoist. Adam Smith’s salute to the “invisible hand” of free markets in favor of the fist of government appears to be losing out in the Trump administration. as these unprecedented policies with no parallel in American history share much more in common with Karl Marx and Mao Zedong than Adam Smith and Ayn Rand. Many now wonder why the Business Roundtable remains missing in action, insulating itself with turgid knowledge, subtracting white papers and passive forums, piously genuflecting to President Trump’s assaults on free-market capitalism that make New York’s Mamdani look like John D. Rockefeller.

The Marxist-style oppression of free enterprise was echoed in assaults on the nation’s top law firms and universities through authoritarian blitzkriegs to suppress constitutionally protected American ideals of freedom of expression, a cornerstone of capitalism. Harvard University, like 60 other universities, has been threatened with a cutoff of foreign-born students and vital federal research funds under the false pretext of antisemitism, despite the Anti-Defamation League giving Harvard passing grades on its tests for antisemitism. Paul Weiss is one of many major law firms that the Trump administration threatened with having its security clearance and federal building access denied, merely by offering to represent independent citizen voices attacked by Trump for noncompliance with his thought police and MAGA political correctness. We have spoken in admiration of the hundreds of universities and law firms that have now unified to stop these totalitarian White House edicts. The legal and academic community remembered what the Business Roundtable and genuine traditional economic conservatives have forgotten, which was Benjamin Franklin’s admonition that “we must all hang together or surely we will hang separately.”

Assembly Constitutional Amendment 8 (Rivas, McGuire): allows Californians the ability to adopt a new, temporary Congressional map that neutralizes Trump’s power grab only if Texas, Florida, Indiana, or any other Republican-led state redraw their maps.

Senate Bill 280 (Cervantes, Pellerin): establishes timelines and procedures to conduct a statewide special election for Proposition 50, and provides the funding for the special election, set to take place on November 4, 2025.

Assembly Bill 604 (Aguiar-Curry, Gonzalez): establishes the temporary Congressional District Maps that would take effect if other states engage in mid-cycle partisan gerrymanders.

This bill package builds on Governor Newsom’s framework announced last week in Los Angeles at the Democracy Center, alongside leaders from across the Golden State like Planned Parenthood, labor unions, community organizations and educators, as well as key elected officials at the federal, state, and local level.

Newsom fights back against Trump Administration’s harmful policies

The Trump Administration has been particularly harmful to Californians. However, thanks to California’s proactive efforts to defend its values against the federal administration the state and ultimately the people have been able to recoup at least $168 billion in federal funding. This effort is a direct result of the special session to safeguard Californians earlier this year – so far spending $5 million to support the litigation, representing a 3,360,000% (3.4 million percent) return on investment.","Sentiment score -0.10000000149011612 , Sentiment Magnitude 2.299999952316284","name:Californians type: 2 Salience 0.15625348687171936, name:map type: 5 Salience 0.08257056772708893, name:Congressional District Maps type: 5 Salience 0.04055505245923996, name:Assembly Constitutional Amendment 8 type: 5 Salience 0.038144804537296295, name:Newsom type: 1 Salience 0.028838511556386948, name:Trump type: 1 Salience 0.024302570149302483, name:Congressional type: 3 Salience 0.019496053457260132, name:Texas type: 2 Salience 0.019496053457260132, name:Rivas type: 1 Salience 0.019496053457260132, name:McGuire type: 1 Salience 0.019496053457260132, name:state type: 2 Salience 0.017742514610290527, name:maps type: 5 Salience 0.014227189123630524, name:states type: 2 Salience 0.01203104481101036, name:election type: 4 Salience 0.009559674188494682, name:Bill 280 type: 5 Salience 0.009184882044792175, name:people type: 1 Salience 0.00915494468063116, name:educators type: 1 Salience 0.00775317195802927, name:officials type: 1 Salience 0.00775317195802927, name:leaders type: 1 Salience 0.00775317195802927, name:labor unions type: 3 Salience 0.00775317195802927","Category:/Law & Government/Government , Category_confidence:74.0%"
https://www.aacr.org/blog/2025/08/18/eye-on-ai-applying-artificial-intelligence-to-drive-cancer-research-part-2/,"Artificial intelligence (AI) may be all over the news now, but it’s been in oncology clinics for more than three decades, helping oncologists analyze mammograms and other imaging scans to detect signs of cancer—albeit with some limitations. With recent technological advances, however, cancer researchers are now exploring new possibilities for AI, improving existing applications and developing additional ones to expand AI’s role in the clinic.

At the AACR Special Conference on Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning and the AACR webinar on AI and Machine Learning in IO, presenters discussed how AI can be applied across the cancer research spectrum, highlighting its promise to improve our understanding of cancer biology, accelerate drug development, and improve patient care. In Part 1 of this blog post, we dove into some of the innovative applications for discovery science and translational cancer research discussed at these events.

Here, we will examine some of the promising clinical applications of AI, including its ability to enhance cancer diagnosis, guide precision medicine, and even facilitate the development of other clinical AI tools.

Improving Cancer Diagnoses

Accurate cancer diagnosis is key to ensuring patients receive the appropriate treatment for their cancer. This entails not only identifying cancer type (the organ where the cancer originated), but in many cases also determining the cancer subtype (which can be based on the cell or tissue it affects, the genetic alterations involved, and/or its morphologic features).

The complex process of diagnosing cancer subtypes typically relies on the expertise of pathologists to identify and interpret characteristics from hematoxylin and eosin (H&E)-stained tumor tissue, sometimes supplemented by data from sophisticated and expensive clinical assays like tumor genome sequencing.

AI, however, could help make this process more efficient and accessible, according to research presented by Kevin Boehm, MD, PhD, of Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, during the AACR Special Conference.

Kevin Boehm, MD, PhD

“An area where AI has shown superhuman performance is in pattern recognition and scalability,” said Boehm, noting that AI has the potential to quickly review thousands of H&E images, recognize established histologic patterns, and even identify novel, clinically relevant patterns.

Boehm presented an AI architecture designed to infer subtype and genomic information from digitized images of H&E-stained tumor tissue. The first step of the architecture was an AI-based model called AEON, which analyzed H&E images from roughly 80,000 samples to identify patterns that it then used, in combination with information from the open-source cancer classification system OncoTree, to classify the histologic subtype of each tumor.

AEON, combined with OncoTree, classified cancer subtypes with 78% accuracy, Boehm reported, and it was able to reclassify tumors into a more granular subtype than they had been assigned by a pathologist. This included reclassifying renal cell carcinomas (RCC) not otherwise specified as either clear cell RCC or papillary RCC subtypes, as well as assigning a cancer type to tumors previously diagnosed as cancers of unknown primary. In most cases, the overall survival of patients with reclassified cancers of unknown primary was consistent with what would be expected for the newly assigned cancer type.

In the second step of the AI architecture, a model called Paladin, also developed by Boehm and colleagues, integrated the granular subtype classifications from AEON with the digitized H&E images to infer genomic properties of each subtype based on patterns captured in the H&E images. Boehm reported that about 5% of the nearly 4,000 variants they examined could be reliably inferred through histologic patterns.

Because AEON identified granular subtypes that are often lumped together, the researchers used Paladin to uncover subtype-specific genotype-phenotype relationships that had been previously masked. MEN1 variants, for example, had been reported to drive pancreatic cancers, but Paladin found that these variants were not as relevant for the neuroendocrine tumor subtype of pancreatic cancer.

This has implications for precision medicine, as targeting certain variants may not be effective against all the subtypes of a particular cancer—underscoring the importance of accurate diagnoses.

“We can’t just lump all of these histologies together and infer genomic features,” Boehm said. “Each granular subtype must be considered separately.”

Because the AI architecture relies on H&E images instead of expensive sequencing methods, Boehm suggested that, with further research, it also “has the potential to help extend access to precision oncology to centers where it’s not logistically or financially feasible to run DNA sequencing on a large cohort of patients.”

(In another recent blog post, we discussed how AI-driven analysis of digital H&E images enhanced the diagnosis of pediatric sarcomas.)

Predicting Treatment Responses

Another emerging clinical application of AI is to predict how a patient’s cancer will respond to a particular treatment. This can help physicians decide which treatment to pursue so that patients can avoid undergoing therapies that are unlikely to be effective.

Arnav Mehta, MD, PhD

During the AACR webinar, Arnav Mehta, MD, PhD, of Stanford University, shared recent research that illustrated how AI can help researchers identify biomarkers or intercellular interactions associated with immunotherapy responses and integrate multiple types of data to improve response predictions.

“We’re in a really exciting era in how we use machine learning and artificial [intelligence] tools, not just in basic science or at the level of target identification, but really across the entire drug discovery cycle with … better clinical development and patient stratification,” Mehta said.

Using ‘Synthetic’ Patients to Guide Precision Medicine

A major obstacle to using AI to predict treatment outcomes, however, is that the development of AI models for this purpose requires large swaths of patient data that are not always available or representative of the patient population.

Research from Hanna Hieromnimon, of the University of Chicago, presented at the AACR Special Conference, suggests that AI-generated patient data—that is, artificial data from synthetic patients—could be one way to overcome this hurdle.

“Currently, researchers rely on limited public datasets that may not represent the full diversity of cancer patients,” said Hieromnimon. “Our goal was to create a method that can generate realistic ‘synthetic’ patients—complete with both digital pathology images and clinical data—that could help researchers build better multimodal AI models for cancer diagnosis and treatment [response] prediction.”

Hanna Hieromnimon

Hieromnimon and colleagues developed an AI-based tool that was trained on clinical information and digitized histology images from real patients. The model used these inputs to learn the connections between the provided clinical and histologic data and develop a reference map that plotted real patients based on their similarities to one another—the more similar that two patients are, the shorter the distance between them on the reference map. Finally, the model used the reference map as a guide for generating realistic synthetic patients.

When an AI model was trained on data from 1,000 synthetic lung cancer patients, it predicted immunotherapy responses with similar accuracy as when it was trained on data from 1,630 real patients (68.3% vs. 67.9% accuracy, respectively). And regardless of whether the model was trained on real or synthetic data, it correctly identified bone or liver metastases and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels as prognostic factors.

“Synthetic patients were remarkably faithful to real patient data,” Hieromnimon said. She explained that the use of synthetic patients could accelerate the development of AI models by allowing investigators to augment their training data and impute missing data to improve the performance of their models. Synthetic patients could also enhance scientific collaboration, she added, explaining that since synthetic data does not have the same privacy concerns as real patient data, it can be shared more easily—which could help expand the reach of AI-based tools that advance precision medicine.

“Precision cancer treatment relies on expensive molecular tests that aren’t available globally,” Hieromnimon noted. “AI excels at finding subtle patterns across multiple data types simultaneously … If we can develop better AI models that work with standard tissue images, more patients could benefit from personalized treatment regardless of their geographic location or economic circumstances.”

With the growing influence of AI in cancer research and clinical care, it will be necessary to carefully consider the pros and cons of new AI tools, promote open science, and enhance collaboration, said panelists during the “AI Synergy Forum: Fostering Innovation Through Collaboration” session at the AACR Special Conference.

Panelist Elana J. Fertig, PhD, of the University of Mayland School of Medicine, noted that researchers should consider whether their AI model solves a new problem or uncovers a novel aspect of biology, whether it is easier to use than conventional methods, and how it performs relative to other methods. Additionally, understanding the conditions in which the model no longer works and scrutinizing performance data are key to ensuring that a model isn’t “too good to be true.”

During the “AI Synergy Forum: Fostering Innovation Through Collaboration” session, panelists discussed various considerations for the development and evaluation of AI tools.

Once effective models are developed, ensuring that others can access the data and code that led to their development is an important step towards open science, said panelist Shirin A. Enger, PhD, of McGill University in Montreal. This will require efforts to protect patient privacy when sharing data, as well as proactive code annotation so that other researchers can reuse a code.

Ultimately, the goal of using AI tools is to use existing data in a way that benefits patients. Panelist Skye Bork, from PACT AI, emphasized the mutually beneficial power of collaboration between startup companies and academic centers to drive faster science and better care. As an example, she highlighted how her company has collaborated with academic centers to develop and deploy AI models to prescreen patients for clinical trials using patient data from electronic health records and information from the clinicaltrials.gov website.

With these considerations, AI has the potential to transform cancer research and patient care. As Bork noted, “Our goal here is better and faster care for patients. I think we’re united in that.”

In higher education, English teaching is considered a crucial subject, and its teaching quality and assessment effectiveness have always been a focus of attention1,2,3. Traditional methods for evaluating English instruction face numerous challenges, including a narrow assessment approach, unscientific evaluation criteria, and incomplete data, all of which limit the potential to enhance teaching quality. With the advancements in information technology, the integration of big data and artificial intelligence (AI) has introduced new perspectives and methodologies for English teaching evaluation. As a key branch of AI, deep learning (DL) offers powerful data analysis and pattern recognition capabilities, offering robust support for reforming and innovating English teaching assessment4,5,6.

Traditional English teaching assessment relies on teachers’ subjective judgment and standardized tests, which often leads to limited evaluation dimensions and delayed feedback. Manual scoring requires substantial time and fails to capture students’ subtle progress. Standardized testing focuses on outcomes while neglecting the accumulation of process-based data. The introduction of DL and data mining technologies can address these limitations through automated scoring, multidimensional data analysis, and real-time feedback mechanisms. However, current research still lacks in algorithm integration and adaptability of assessment models, which is the primary focus of this study. DL enables personalized learning by recommending resources and activities suited to students’ habits, abilities, and needs. Such personalization is essential for fostering autonomous learning and improving English language competence. Data mining refers to the process of extracting valuable information and knowledge from large datasets, including clustering analysis, association rule mining, classification, and prediction7,8,9. In the context of college English assessment, data mining can be used to analyze student behavior and evaluate teaching quality. This study aims to construct an efficient and equitable assessment framework by integrating DL with data mining technologies to meet the practical needs of large-scale educational settings.

Research gap

Most existing work focuses on the isolated application of data mining techniques, overlooking the collaborative potential of combining architectures like Transformer with Bayesian frameworks to achieve personalized learning. Previous studies usually aggregate student data without analyzing gender differences in learning preferences and skill priorities. As a result, the lack of transparent model architectures prevents educators from auditing the contribution of different functions. This study addresses the gap through interpretable decision rules and aims to fill these deficiencies by using a transformer–Bayesian integrated framework and combining behavioral sequences with multi-source assessment data.

Research objectives

This work aims to advance the reform and innovation of English teaching assessment and achieve personalized English instruction through the application of DL and AI-driven data mining techniques. By analyzing and summarizing the current state of relevant research, this work explores the role of DL in English teaching models and proposes a Bayesian approach to personalized instruction. Simultaneously, utilizing AI data mining techniques, a new English teaching assessment method is introduced to enhance teaching quality and assessment effectiveness.

With the continuous development of data mining and DL technologies, their application prospects in college English teaching evaluation are becoming increasingly broad. This work aims to explore the practical application of these technologies in teaching, and provide new ideas and methods for college English education. The specific research questions include: How can students’ learning behavior data be analyzed to predict their exam scores? Which factors have the most significant impact on the development of students’ English proficiency? Section 1 describes the research background, objectives, and necessity. Section 2 summarizes the current research status of DL and AI data mining in English teaching. Section 3 primarily focuses on exploring English teaching models based on DL, proposing the Bayesian method for personalized English instruction, and introducing an English teaching assessment method based on AI data mining. Section 4 focuses on experimental analysis, including dataset processing and result prediction. Section 5 concludes contributions and limitations, and suggests future research directions. This work successfully applies the Transformer architecture, originally from the field of natural language processing (NLP), to the education sector. This interdisciplinary integration not only expands the application scope of the Transformer architecture but also introduces novel methods for data processing and evaluation in education. By leveraging the powerful feature extraction and sequence modeling capabilities of the Transformer, this approach enables a deeper understanding of students’ learning behaviors, facilitating more accurate personalized teaching assessments.

Literature review

In the field of language education, particularly English teaching, the rapid development of DL and AI technologies has brought the quality of instruction and assessment to the forefront of attention in both academic and practical domains. This section focuses on the application and impact of DL/AI in language education. Vaswani et al. (2017)10 proposed a novel and simple network architecture that was entirely based on the attention mechanism, completely eliminating the need for recursion and convolution. Numerous studies have highlighted the significance of English teaching in higher education. Eke et al. (2021)11 pointed out that English teaching not only enhanced students’ cross-cultural communication skills but also played a crucial role in fostering a global perspective and competitiveness. Similarly, Lu & Vivekananda (2023)12 emphasized the importance of English teaching quality in improving students’ overall competencies and employability. These studies provide a solid theoretical foundation for exploring the application of DL in language education. However, traditional teaching methods have limitations when it comes to assessing students’ English proficiency. To address these limitations, Peng et al. (2022)13 began exploring the application of DL/AI in language education. Their research revealed that by leveraging big data and machine learning algorithms, student proficiency in English could be assessed more accurately, enabling the provision of more personalized teaching strategies. This discovery offers new insights and methods for innovation in language education.

In discussing how DL technology enhances English teaching and supports personalized learning, the focus should be its applications in NLP, learning resource recommendation, and sentiment analysis. DL technology can comprehend and process language information more deeply by mimicking the human brain’s information processing. This capability is crucial for enhancing the quality and efficiency of English teaching. Next, the applications and effectiveness of DL technology in these areas are specifically analyzed. Zhu et al. (2021)14 utilized DL’s NLP techniques to design a system that thoroughly understands and processes students’ language inputs. This system enables more accurate semantic analysis and grammar correction, thereby improving students’ language application skills. Additionally, the system can assess students’ writing in real time and provide targeted suggestions for grammar and vocabulary improvements, fundamentally enhancing students’ writing proficiency. Concurrently, Agüero-Torales et al. (2021)15 proposed using DL recommendation algorithms to analyze students’ learning journeys, preferences, and performance. This method accurately recommends the most suitable learning resources and activities, further achieving the goal of personalized learning. Zhong et al. (2020)16 applied DL to sentiment analysis, and designed a system capable of interpreting students’ emotional feedback on learning materials. This sentiment analysis system enables teachers to adapt their strategies to meet students’ individual needs and quickly identifies learning challenges or areas of interest, facilitating targeted intervention and support. The application of DL technology in English teaching is multifaceted. This not only enhances students’ language proficiency but also provides tailored recommendations for learning resources based on their progress and preferences. Additionally, the sentiment analysis provides teachers with deeper insights into students’ needs, allowing for more customized instruction. These advancements not only elevate the quality of personalized teaching but also equip educators with diverse strategies and methods, enhancing teaching efficiency and precision. As DL technology continues to evolve, it is reasonable to expect an even more significant impact on English education, enriching students’ learning experiences and providing higher-quality educational outcomes.

In modern society, the rapid advancement of big data and AI technology is transforming the educational landscape, especially in the assessment of English teaching in higher education. These innovations have redefined traditional teaching models, introducing new perspectives and methodologies for evaluation. To enhance the quality of education and the effectiveness of assessments, researchers are increasingly integrating these technologies into English teaching evaluation, striving for improved educational outcomes. Dang et al. (2020)17 proposed a DL-based automatic scoring model for English composition, effectively enhancing scoring efficiency and accuracy. Kumar (2020)18 utilized association rule mining techniques to analyze students’ English scores, discovering potential teaching issues and trends. In terms of research methods, researchers have utilized various approaches and technological tools to validate the effectiveness of their research hypotheses and models. For instance, Mostafa and Benabbou (2020)19 conducted experiments comparing traditional grading methods with DL-based grading methods, gaining valuable insights into students’ and teachers’ perceptions and experiences with AI-based teaching assessment. The findings indicated a greater acceptance of advanced teaching assessment methods among both educators and learners.

With the advancement of computer technology and AI, intelligent assessment has made significant progress in evaluating students’ abilities and knowledge levels. Kartika et al. (2023)20 argued that intelligent assessment could diagnose and analyze students’ specific subject knowledge and competencies based on extensive longitudinal learning data, enabling modeling and dynamic analysis of the learning process. Tang et al. (2022)21 mentioned methods such as simulation-based and game-based assessments, which provided students with complete, authentic, and open problem contexts, allowing them to explore and express themselves freely within task scenarios. Maghsudi et al. (2021)22 employed DL technology to develop student models and learning resource recommendation systems, offering personalized learning paths and resources tailored to students’ learning conditions and interests.

These studies demonstrate the tremendous potential and actual effectiveness of big data and AI technologies in English teaching assessment. These technologies not only enhance the efficiency and accuracy of scoring but also facilitate the identification of teaching issues and trends, thereby providing evidence for teaching improvements. Furthermore, comparative experiments with traditional assessment methods enable researchers and educators to intuitively grasp the benefits of AI-driven assessment approaches, fostering innovation and development in educational technology.

Research model

The framework proposed combines the sequence modeling capabilities of the Transformer architecture with Bayesian inference for personalized learning. The Transformer architecture uses a self-attention mechanism to capture temporal dependencies in learning behaviors, modeling the “learning input-performance output” relationship through an encoder-decoder structure. A Monte Carlo dropout approximation is introduced to model uncertainty, and Bayesian posterior distributions are used to integrate multimodal assessment data, enhancing the robustness of predictions.

Personalized english teaching in college based on DL

The central concept of personalized learning is to address the individual differences that arise during the learning process. Each learner possesses distinct characteristics, such as unique learning preferences and specific areas of weakness. Consequently, personalized learning adopts a customized approach, providing tailored learning advice and methods based on each user’s learning context. This individualized method aims not only to help students bridge knowledge gaps but also to cultivate curiosity and confidence in unfamiliar subjects.

In implementing personalized learning, various tools and methods can be employed, such as interactive ability tests, to comprehensively assess learners’ learning processes and gain a clearer understanding of their strengths and weaknesses23,24. Internet-based education platforms provide a convenient space for personalized learning, enabling students to select appropriate resources based on their needs and learning pace. Meanwhile, effective learning strategies are essential in this process. Comprehensive assessments, pre-class quizzes, and post-class quizzes can enhance students’ deep understanding and mastery of knowledge, making personalized learning an efficient and effective educational model.

In applying Bayesian statistics based on DL in education, the fundamental concept is to treat a student’s learning efficiency as a probability distribution that evolves over time25,26,27. By meticulously observing and recording each instance of a student’s learning activity, the system can continuously update the assessment of the student’s learning efficiency, ensuring it aligns more closely with their actual circumstances. This personalized approach to evaluating learning efficiency effectively addresses individual differences among students, enabling more targeted recommendations for learning strategies and resources. According to Bayesian theorem, the posterior distribution of a student’s learning efficiency can be represented as:

$$P\left( {\theta \left| D \right.} \right)=\frac{{P\left( {D\left| \theta \right.} \right) \cdot P\left( \theta \right)}}{{P\left( D \right)}}$$ (1)

\(\theta\) represents the student’s learning efficiency, and D is all observed learning data. \(P\left( {\theta \left| D \right.} \right)\) is the posterior probability of \(\theta\) given data D; \(P\left( {D\left| \theta \right.} \right)\) is the probability (likelihood) of observing data D given learning efficiency \(\theta\); \(P\left( \theta \right)\) is the prior distribution of student learning efficiency, that is, the efficiency before observing any data; \(P\left( D \right)\) is the marginal probability of data D.

In mathematical statistics, the likelihood function is a function of the parameters of a statistical model that expresses the likelihood of those parameters. The likelihood function is crucial for statistical inference, including applications such as maximum likelihood estimation and Fisher information. While the terms “likelihood,” “plausibility,” and “probability” are closely related and all refer to the chance of an event occurring, they have distinct meanings in a statistical context.

Probability is employed to predict the outcomes of future observations given certain parameters are known, while likelihood is utilized to estimate the parameters of interest given certain observed outcomes. Specifically, given the output x, the likelihood function \(L\left( {\theta \left| x \right.} \right)\) about parameter \(\theta\) (numerically) equals the probability of variable \(X=x\) given parameter \(\theta\):

$$L\left( {\theta \left| x \right.} \right)=P\left( {X=x\left| \theta \right.} \right)$$ (2)

To evaluate the likelihood function for parameter \(\theta\), it is numerically equivalent to the conditional probability of observing result X given parameter \(\theta\), which is also known as the posterior probability of X. Generally, a higher value of the likelihood function indicates that parameter \(\theta\) is more plausible given the outcome \(X=x\). Therefore, formally, the likelihood function is a type of conditional probability function, but with a shift in focus: this work is interested in the likelihood value for A taking the parameter \(\theta\).

$$\theta \left\langle { - - } \right\rangle P\left( {B\left| {A=\theta } \right.} \right)$$ (3)

Through interactive guidance, students can personally experience their progress in each English learning session and receive the system’s positive feedback on different learning states. This personalized feedback mechanism enhances students’ understanding of their performance in the course, fostering enthusiasm and confidence in their learning journey.

This work primarily investigates the design of effective guidance strategies to help diverse students complete their coursework more efficiently and address their personalized learning needs. Figure 1 illustrates the comprehensive recommendation strategy for English teaching. The system leverages integrated recommendations and indices to offer content suggestions that align more closely with users’ learning requirements, thereby accelerating the learning process28,29,30. Additionally, it emphasizes comfort zone guidance as a recommendation approach, enabling users to gradually expand their learning comfort zones, which facilitates a smoother growth trajectory. Ultimately, by fostering situational learning interests, the system can gain a holistic understanding of users’ learning needs and provide a more engaging and personalized educational experience. The integrated application of interactive guidance and guidance strategies seeks to stimulate students’ positive attitudes towards learning, enhance their enthusiasm for learning, and ultimately achieve more effective learning outcomes31,32. In the Bayesian framework, determining and updating the prior distribution are key steps. This work employs a statistical analysis method based on historical data to determine the prior distribution and updates it in real-time to accommodate students’ learning progress. This dynamic update mechanism ensures that the model accurately reflects the students’ true learning situation. Whenever new learning data is generated, the posterior distribution is recalculated based on Bayes’ theorem and used as the prior distribution for the next prediction.

Process of AI data mining

Data mining is the process of uncovering hidden information within large datasets using algorithms. This process, often associated with computer science, employs various methods such as statistics, online analytical processing, information retrieval, machine learning, expert systems, and pattern recognition33,34,35. The data mining process includes steps like data preparation, integration, selection, and preprocessing. Its primary goal is to discover knowledge that is relevant, understandable, applicable, and supportive of specific application discovery challenges.

In data mining, the decision tree algorithm is a supervised learning algorithm utilized for classification and regression problems36,37,38. It constructs a decision tree by recursively dividing the dataset into smaller subsets. In this construction, each node represents a test condition for a feature attribute, and each branch corresponds to the outcome of that feature attribute in a specific value range. Each leaf node stores a category or a specific numerical value. This work adopts a feature selection method based on information gain. Specifically, the information gain of each feature relative to the target variable is calculated, and the top N features with the highest information gain are selected as model inputs. During the construction of the decision tree, the Gini index is used as the splitting criterion. A smaller Gini index indicates higher node purity. The decision tree is built by recursively selecting the optimal splitting feature and splitting point. Table 1 shows the advantages of the decision tree method compared to neural networks and support vector machines.

Microsoft’s decision tree algorithm constructs efficient data mining models by carefully designing a series of splits in the tree structure. Figure 2 is the structure of the decision tree model. Whenever the algorithm identifies a significant correlation between a column in the input data and the predictable column, it introduces a new node into the model. The construction process of the Microsoft decision tree begins by treating the entire dataset as a single node. The goal is to partition the sample set based on a particular attribute to purify the class distribution in the subnodes as much as possible. This process relies on selecting the optimal split point to either maximize information gain or minimize Gini impurity, thus achieving effective classification of the samples. T The partitioning stops when all samples belong to the same class or when the preset maximum depth is reached; otherwise, the best split point is chosen for further partitioning. Ultimately, the class of each leaf node is determined based on the principle of “the majority rules.” This process not only helps to understand students’ learning behavior patterns but also provides strong support for personalized teaching. In terms of feature selection, the Microsoft decision tree mainly considers the frequency of feature occurrences and their proximity to the root node. Features that frequently appear and are closer to the root are generally considered to have a greater impact on classification results. Here, different question type scores and exam performance are identified as key factors influencing students’ success in exams, and the position of these features in the decision tree reflects their importance. Moreover, information gain, as one of the feature selection criteria, measures the extent to which a particular attribute enhances classification purity, while Gini impurity is adopted to quantify the probability of elements within a set being misclassified. These two methods work together to ensure that the model effectively captures the key information in the data.

The Microsoft decision tree algorithm uses “feature selection” to determine the most valuable attributes. These techniques help prevent irrelevant attributes from consuming processor time, thus improving performance, and enhancing the quality of analysis. Figure 3 illustrates the decision tree building process. This algorithm is primarily utilized in data mining and machine learning, assisting users in extracting useful information and knowledge from large datasets. By building decision tree models, users can uncover associations and patterns within the data, applying these insights to practical challenges such as fraud detection and credit scoring39,40.

The dataset used in this study contains textual features, numerical features, and categorical labels, displaying characteristics of high-dimensional mixed data. The decision tree algorithm is selected as the preferred method because it requires no complex preprocessing and can directly handle both categorical and continuous variables. The dataset includes 1,500 samples with a moderate number of features, allowing the decision tree to strike a good balance between computational efficiency and model interpretability. In contrast, neural networks, although capable of capturing complex patterns, are not the optimal choice in this context due to their black-box nature and high computational cost.

In the initial stages of data mining, data preprocessing is a crucial step that encompasses data cleaning, transformation, feature extraction, and more. For textual data such as student assignments and classroom discussions in English teaching evaluations, the Transformer architecture can handle such unstructured data. Through preprocessing techniques like tokenization, stop-word removal, and word embedding, textual data are converted into numerical data that models can process. The Transformer architecture, a significant advancement in recent years in NLP, excels in capturing long-range dependencies within sequences and handling complex textual data, offering fresh insights into English teaching evaluations. This work builds on the foundations of data mining and utilizes the Transformer architecture in English teaching evaluations. It leverages the model’s powerful feature extraction and sequence modeling capabilities to achieve a comprehensive understanding and accurate assessment of students’ English learning experiences. The Transformer architecture employs a multi-head attention mechanism, specifically with 8 attention heads, each having a dimension of 64. This configuration helps the model capture richer information while maintaining computational efficiency. The model is trained using the Adam optimizer, with a learning rate set at 0.001. To prevent overfitting, dropout technology is adopted, with a rate of 0.2. During training, the loss function and accuracy on the validation set are monitored, allowing for adjustments to the learning rate and early stopping strategy as needed.

A multi-layer encoder-decoder model is constructed based on the Transformer architecture. The encoder transforms input textual data into a series of feature vectors, while the decoder generates evaluations of student learning based on these feature vectors. During model construction, parameters and structures are adjusted to meet specific requirements, optimizing performance. The self-attention mechanism, which is central to the Transformer model, captures dependencies between any two positions within the sequence. Attention weight calculation reads:

$$Attention(Q,K,V)=softmax(\frac{{Q{K^T}}}{{\sqrt {{d_k}} }})V$$ (4)

In this context, Q represents the query matrix, K is the key matrix, and V is the value matrix. \({d_k}\) refers to the dimensionality of the key vectors, used to scale the dot product to mitigate the issues of gradient vanishing or exploding.

Based on the evaluation results from the Transformer model, personalized learning recommendations and teaching strategies can be tailored for each student. For instance, students who struggle with grammar could be provided with additional exercises and explanations, while those with weak oral expression skills might receive resources for oral practice and pronunciation correction. By employing personalized assessment strategies, educators can more effectively address students’ learning needs and improve overall teaching effectiveness. In the specific implementation of the Transformer architecture, particular attention is given to the configuration of the attention heads and the optimization of the training process. By carefully configuring the attention heads and adopting effective training strategies, the model is able to efficiently process complex text data and extract valuable information for college English teaching evaluation.

DL path in english teaching

Combining Eric Jensen and LeAnn Nickelsen’s DL path (Fig. 4), teachers should first clarify teaching goals and expectations. They should ensure that students not only master fundamental knowledge and skills in English but also develop cross-cultural awareness and self-directed learning abilities.

Fig. 4 The roadmap for students’ DL in English teaching. Full size image

This work develops a DL model tailored to the characteristics of college English teaching, combining the strengths of Bayesian methods and the Transformer architecture to achieve personalized teaching assessments. The model’s input includes multidimensional data such as students’ learning records, assignment completion rates, classroom interaction data, and online learning behaviors. After preprocessing, these data are transformed into feature vectors for model input. In the initial phase, a Bayesian network layer is employed to handle uncertainty. This network infers students’ future learning potential and possible obstacles based on existing learning data and historical performance. Its purpose is to provide a probability-based preliminary assessment for the subsequent Transformer architecture, aiding the model in understanding individual differences among students. Following this, the Transformer architecture processes students’ time series data. Comprising an encoder and a decoder, the encoder extracts features from the input data, while the decoder generates outputs based on these features. In this model, the encoder handles students’ learning records and related data, utilizing a self-attention mechanism to capture complex relationships within the data. The decoder then produces personalized teaching assessment results and predictions based on the encoder’s output. In the pre-assessment stage, teachers must evaluate students’ English proficiency and abilities to establish their starting points and identify areas needing attention. This assessment enables teachers to pinpoint students’ confusions and challenges in English learning, thereby facilitating the development of targeted teaching strategies.

In order to create an environment conducive to DL, teachers should offer a diverse array of learning materials and resources, including textbooks, online resources, and multimedia materials41,42,43. These resources not only broaden students’ knowledge but also enhance their interest and motivation to learn. Additionally, teachers need to create authentic contexts through situational simulations, role-playing, and similar methods, enabling students to connect English with real-life situations and develop cross-cultural communication skills.

In activating students’ prior knowledge, teachers can employ techniques such as questioning, discussion, or providing relevant cases to help students recall and associate previously learned content. This process facilitates the integration of new knowledge with existing understanding, leading to deeper comprehension and meaning44,45,46.

Acquiring new knowledge is a crucial step in DL. Teachers must explain, demonstrate, and guide students in mastering new vocabulary, grammar, and expressions. In the deep processing stage, they should guide students in summarizing and organizing what they have learned to build a cohesive knowledge system. Additionally, teachers should design projects or tasks that allow students to apply English in real-life situations, fostering their innovative thinking and problem-solving skills47. These activities not only aid in the internalization of knowledge but also enhance students’ language proficiency and cross-cultural communication skills. In this study, students are divided into an interactive group (n = 145) and a non-interactive group (n = 145). The former uses an AI-driven real-time feedback system, while the latter relys on traditional instruction. Classroom activities in the interactive group include NLP-based instant essay correction and personalized learning path recommendations. In contrast, the non-interactive group only receives uniform explanations from the teacher.","Sentiment score 0.20000000298023224 , Sentiment Magnitude 84.0","name:DL type: 1 Salience 0.0002568899653851986, name:Transformer type: 6 Salience 0.010055843740701675, name:students type: 1 Salience 0.007145798299461603, name:teaching evaluation type: 5 Salience 0.00647088373079896, name:teachers type: 1 Salience 0.0027087160851806402, name:teaching models type: 6 Salience 0.002248326549306512, name:educators type: 1 Salience 0.0019742795266211033, name:image type: 5 Salience 0.0019238459644839168, name:learners type: 1 Salience 0.0017603886080905795, name:Peng et al. type: 1 Salience 0.0016981411026790738, name:AI type: 3 Salience 0.0013221761910244823, name:state type: 2 Salience 0.0012871096841990948, name:Tang et al. type: 1 Salience 0.0012599924812093377, name:researchers type: 1 Salience 0.0010987557470798492, name:branch type: 2 Salience 0.0009999626781791449, name:introduction type: 4 Salience 0.0008719019242562354, name:novel type: 5 Salience 0.0008269374375231564, name:student type: 1 Salience 0.0007122510578483343, name:learner type: 1 Salience 0.000680853147059679, name:users type: 1 Salience 0.000658053788356483","Category:/Jobs & Education/Education , Category_confidence:74.0%"

A version of this story appeared in CNN Business’ Nightcap newsletter. To get it in your inbox, sign up for free here.

Not long ago, American conservative orthodoxy held that when it comes to doing business, the government that governs least governs best.

The orthodoxy manifested itself in familiar ways. Groups that claimed the mantle of individual liberties would decry new legislation. Talk radio and podcasts would mock unnamed bureaucrats for ham-fisted overreach. And powerful business lobbies were quick to denounce — in press releases and even lawsuits — regulations or taxes they saw as government overreach.

But when faced with President Donald Trump’s efforts to seize control of private enterprise — such as his recent arrangement to have the US pocket a portion of Nvidia’s sales to China, his social media outbursts at individual executives, his moves to take a stake in Intel, and his use of executive powers to cajole banks and law firms he perceives as insufficiently loyal — those same groups have gone quiet.

Take the US Chamber of Commerce, the largest business advocacy group in the country.

Last year, the Chamber sued a federal consumer watchdog group for attempting to cap credit card late fees at $8 a month, claiming the agency “exceeded its statutory authority.” In 2023, it sued the Biden administration over provisions for Medicare price negotiations in the Inflation Reduction Act, claiming the move would consolidate “unfettered and unchecked power” to the department of Health and Human Services.

But under Trump’s second term, the Chamber has had little to say publicly about Trump’s aggressive meddling in the private sector.

Similarly, the Business Roundtable, another DC-based lobbying group that represents hundreds of chief executives, has rarely been shy about denouncing what it sees as presidential overreach in the form of taxes and environmental regulations. This year, though, the group has been largely MIA on the MAGA shift toward a style of capitalism that more closely resembles the autocratic regimes of Russia and China.

Both groups have criticized Trump’s trade war, warning that tariffs hurt American businesses. But neither has spoken out about the president’s more direct assault on free enterprise.

Neither the Chamber of Commerce nor the Business Roundtable responded to multiple requests for comment.

The ‘Eye of Sauron’ factor

The president, a self-styled dealmaker, has thrown out the standard free-market playbook in ways that have alarmed lawmakers, investors and legal experts. And suddenly, the legal protections businesses have long counted on appear shaky, said Philip M. Nichols, a professor of legal studies and business ethics at the University of Pennsylvania’s Wharton School.

“Any business that sticks its head up, or any business person that sticks their head up, is taking a risk that can’t be calculated,” Nichols said in an interview. “What’s the smart thing to do — what do the wildebeest do when they get to the crocodile-infected river? They wait for the other wildebeest to jump in, and then follow.”

Several trade groups have privately drafted plans to push back against the Trump administration in defense of their business interests, people familiar with the matter told CNN. But those plans were shelved at the request of members that are worried about drawing White House ire.

“There’s an ‘Eye of Sauron’ element here that everyone is very aware of,” one manufacturing CEO told CNN, referring to the “Lord of the Rings” character that brought all subjects to heel. “But there’s also a recognition that this is an administration that is transactional if they believe you’re on board with their agenda.”

When it comes to exerting his influence over Corporate America, no matter appears too small or too large for Trump’s input.

Last month, the president took credit for Coca-Cola’s decision to roll out a cane-sugar-sweetened product that aligns with his allies’ “Make America Healthy Again” philosophy. He regularly criticizes CEOs in public for perceived slights, demanded that Intel’s boss resign over unspecified conflicts, and urged Goldman Sachs to fire its top economist after the bank said tariffs would raise consumer prices (a fact virtually all economists agree to be true, and which we are now seeing borne out in reality).

While much of that bluster is run-of-the-mill Trump rhetoric, the president shocked trade experts when he announced an unorthodox (and potentially illegal) arrangement with chipmakers Nvidia and AMD earlier this month. In exchange for export licenses that allow them to sell their products in China, the companies agreed to funnel 15% of their China sales to the US government — a setup that some analysts called a “shakedown” of private enterprise.

The White House’s push into private businesses took another turn Tuesday when officials confirmed the administration was considering using taxpayer money to acquire a stake in struggling chipmaker Intel. The primary reason for such a move, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said, was the president’s desire to reduce US dependence on Taiwan for chip production. But he also said Trump believes the government should have “equity” in tech giants.

Risk calculus

The silence from Corporate America to Trump’s incursion into private businesses isn’t entirely unexpected. Businesses have lost their appetite for the kind of socially progressive rhetoric many adopted in response to the 2020 murder of George Floyd. At the same time, Trump’s return to the White House came with a cost-benefit analysis for any business leaders thinking of speaking out: Make yourself a target, or fall in line and wait for the massive tax cuts the president has promised.

“Corporate citizens are harmed just like flesh and blood citizens are harmed when you have a leader who… actively seeks to monetize public office and actively seeks to use the power of the presidency to harm perceived enemies or anyone who doesn’t appropriately capitulate,” Donald Sherman, executive director of the Center for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, told CNN. “In some ways, this is the natural and predictable result of failing to appropriately stand up to President Trump’s anti-democratic and authoritarian tendencies during his first term.”","Sentiment score -0.30000001192092896 , Sentiment Magnitude 19.899999618530273","name:Donald Trump type: 1 Salience 0.13418550789356232, name:Nvidia type: 3 Salience 0.06492521613836288, name:Business Roundtable type: 3 Salience 0.029421547427773476, name:Groups type: 3 Salience 0.02857922948896885, name:Chamber of Commerce type: 3 Salience 0.027825605124235153, name:government type: 3 Salience 0.02404283545911312, name:Intel type: 3 Salience 0.01895139552652836, name:press releases type: 5 Salience 0.016802143305540085, name:China type: 2 Salience 0.01194569282233715, name:president type: 1 Salience 0.010736544616520405, name:administration type: 3 Salience 0.008093610405921936, name:businesses type: 3 Salience 0.007784033659845591, name:newsletter type: 5 Salience 0.0067054047249257565, name:story type: 5 Salience 0.0067054047249257565, name:version type: 5 Salience 0.0067054047249257565, name:legislation type: 5 Salience 0.006615441758185625, name:mantle type: 2 Salience 0.006615441758185625, name:podcasts type: 5 Salience 0.006602915469557047, name:bureaucrats type: 1 Salience 0.006602915469557047, name:companies type: 3 Salience 0.006508458871394396","Category:/News/Politics , Category_confidence:73.0%"

The effective average tariff rate imposed by the United States is now roughly 18%, according to calculations made by the Yale Budget Lab. This is the highest tariff rate since the early 1930s. Moreover, it is 15 percentage points higher than at the start of the year. Recall that, in 1930, the US Congress enacted the Smoot Hawley Tariff Act, which increased the average tariff rate by 6.5 percentage points. It led to retaliation by other countries. The result was that it greatly exacerbated the Great Depression, including a massive reduction in global trade.

In this case, there has not yet been substantial retaliation, but the increase in prices and the commensurate reduction in purchasing power will likely have a negative impact on US growth. The Yale Budget Lab estimates that real GDP growth in 2026 will be 1 percentage point below the baseline forecast and, in the years to come, annual growth will be 0.5 percentage points below the baseline. This assumes that the current tariff rates remain in place. The reduction in growth will likely be driven by weakness in both manufacturing and construction. Although durable goods manufacturing is expected to improve, other areas of manufacturing may worsen, especially advanced manufacturing.

Leaving aside the Yale Budget Lab forecasts, the reality is that an 18% tariff applied to last year’s US$3.3 trillion in imports implies roughly US$600 billion in additional annual government revenue, or about 2.1% of GDP. Think of that as an annual tax increase of 2.1% of GDP, more than offsetting the impact of the tax cuts in the bill recently passed by the US Congress. All other things being equal, that will likely have a sharp negative impact on real GDP growth. Moreover, even if the tariffs are not fully passed onto consumers, then businesses will see a sharp decline in profits. Either way, there could be a negative economic impact.

On the other hand, such a large increase in the prices of imported goods would likely lead to a decline in the volume of imports, thereby reducing the net impact on GDP. If there is a substantial decline in the volume of imports, that will be a negative shock to the exports of other countries. Moreover, if businesses begin to see the new level of tariffs as permanent, it will likely lead to a redesign of supply chains as well as significant shifts in global trade patterns.

Finally, one might argue that, given the large US budget deficit, a tax increase might be welcome. Yet the challenge with tariffs as a source of revenue is that they have different impacts on different industries, shift production toward lower value-added processes, hurt business investment, exacerbate income inequality, and could ultimately damage productivity and growth.

Meanwhile, there continues to be debate about the potential inflationary effect of tariffs. Many analysts have noted the lack of significant US inflation so far this year. Some analysts have suggested that there won’t be significant inflation. They point to foreign exporters taking a hit to margins by lowering export prices. They also point to domestic sellers also taking a hit to margins by not fully passing on tariffs to their customers.

This is all true. However, it is likely that these companies attempted to maintain market share on the expectation that tariffs would be temporary. They evidently believed that the tariffs imposed by the United States were meant to compel changed behavior by other countries, after which tariffs would be reduced. Yet that is not what has happened. Instead, the United States has compelled other countries to make certain commitments. In exchange, the United States has agreed to not impose steep tariffs but has left in place historically high tariffs. My expectation is, once companies recognize the permanence of tariffs, they will raise prices accordingly.

Indeed, one large consumer products company announced that, in the coming year, it will boost US prices by 5% to offset the US$1 billion impact of tariffs. Also, investors evidently expect tariffs to boost inflation. The five-year breakeven rate, which is a measure of bond investor expectations of average inflation over the coming five years, has lately increased by about 20 basis points as the final level of tariffs become clear. The breakeven rate had declined after the April tariff announcements as investors worried about a recession that would weaken inflation. Yet now, investors are not changing their view about growth, only their view about inflation.

On the other hand, many investors evidently believe that tariffs will weaken growth and that the boost to inflation will be relatively short-lived. As such, the futures markets indicate that investors expect the Federal Reserve to cut the benchmark interest rate two to three times before the end of this year.

Meanwhile, the US government released monthly data on personal income, consumer expenditures, and the Federal Reserve’s favorite measure of inflation, which is the personal consumption expenditures deflator, or PCE-deflator. This measure of inflation accelerated modestly in June, with prices up 2.7% from a year earlier and up 0.3% from the previous month.

However, the most notable part of the report concerns prices of durable goods, many of which are imported. The PCE-deflator for durables increased 0.5% in both April and June versus the previous month. This was the biggest gain since mid-2022. In addition, the PCE-deflator for durables was up 0.9% from a year earlier in June, the biggest gain since December 2022. Normally, prices of durables decline. Plus, the government also reported that the real volume of durable goods purchased by consumers fell sharply.

This is early evidence of the impact of tariffs. Moreover, these increases do not yet fully reflect the impact of tariffs as businesses have cut prices to partly offset tariffs. The result has been weakened profits. This will not likely continue, especially as it is now clear that high tariffs are here to stay. Thus, expect inflation to accelerate in the months to come. The Yale Budget Lab estimates that, if businesses fully pass through the impact of tariffs, inflation will nearly double in the coming 12 months.","Sentiment score -0.30000001192092896 , Sentiment Magnitude 24.100000381469727","name:US Congress type: 3 Salience 0.04923025518655777, name:investors type: 1 Salience 0.021642573177814484, name:United States type: 2 Salience 0.018488235771656036, name:Yale Budget Lab type: 3 Salience 0.014261127449572086, name:analysts type: 1 Salience 0.011130167171359062, name:countries type: 3 Salience 0.009877344593405724, name:retaliation type: 4 Salience 0.008390898816287518, name:Federal Reserve type: 3 Salience 0.007835578173398972, name:gain type: 4 Salience 0.006973183248192072, name:reduction type: 4 Salience 0.0061206030659377575, name:sellers type: 1 Salience 0.006032452452927828, name:growth type: 4 Salience 0.005535910837352276, name:Smoot Hawley Tariff Act type: 5 Salience 0.004368710797280073, name:consumer products company type: 3 Salience 0.0029110678005963564, name:consumers type: 1 Salience 0.00277605839073658, name:areas type: 2 Salience 0.002766367746517062, name:businesses type: 3 Salience 0.0026352060958743095, name:hit type: 5 Salience 0.0024692800361663103, name:exporters type: 1 Salience 0.0023356517776846886, name:companies type: 3 Salience 0.0022994745522737503","Category:/Business & Industrial , Category_confidence:85.0%"

https://calmatters.org/politics/2025/08/special-election-redistricting-how/,"In summary California counties are scrambling to prepare for Gov. Gavin Newsom’s special election on redrawing congressional districts for the 2026 midterm. The effort will cost tens of millions of dollars.

Calling a statewide special election sounds simple in theory. But executing one with fewer than 75 days notice? As one California county election official put it, that’s a “herculean” effort.

California voting officials are scrambling behind the scenes to prepare for the special election Gov. Gavin Newsom wants this November on his proposal to redraw the state’s congressional districts. But to do so, Newsom needs voters to approve a ballot initiative in an off-year special election that the state has yet to officially approve and schedule.

Democrats want the proposed California maps to offset President Donald Trump and Republicans’ efforts to stack the next congressional election in the GOP’s favor by squeezing more Republican seats out of red states like Texas, Florida and Missouri.

Newsom only released his proposed maps late last week, and state lawmakers — who just returned from a month-long summer recess — are staring down a hard deadline of Friday to greenlight the ballot language before voters in time for a Nov. 4 election.

County election officials are hustling as if the election is happening so they can make sure they lock down everything from vendors to print their ballots, locations for voting centers and election workers to staff those polling places come Nov. 4. They’ve pushed hard for the state to cover the hefty costs of an unplanned special election, and some have noted that without additional appropriations, they might need to cut back on vital public safety and social services.

“It’s difficult for us, just in a regular election, being a smaller rural county,” said Juan Pablo Cervantes, the registrar of voters for Humboldt County, which has just over 85,000 registered voters. Usually Cervantes and his staff have at least five months of lead time to find voting sites, hire staff and procure all the machines, pens and ballots for a statewide election.

“That’s usually a Herculean effort on its own,” Cervantes said.

A mad dash to find ballots and vote centers

One of the biggest challenges for counties is lining up vendors to print enough ballots – including one absentee ballot for every registered voter in the state, as well as a sufficient number to keep onsite for on-site voting at polling stations. California’s secretary of state has only approved seven vendors to print ballots, not including Orange County, which operates its own printing facility.

The other two logistical hurdles are securing enough sites to serve as vote centers, and hiring and training staff to work them.

Soon after Newsom declared on July 31 that he would call a special election, Orange County Registrar of Voters Bob Page gathered his staff for an emergency planning meeting. He instructed them to identify which supplies they needed to order as soon as possible, prioritizing products like ballot paper, ballot envelopes and toner for their ballot printers – which might not arrive in time to meet deadlines if they waited for official confirmation of a special election.

Should the governor end up abandoning his plan, Orange County would also be able to use those materials in next year’s June primary election, minimizing potential waste of taxpayer dollars.

“I had to make a decision that I couldn’t wait until Aug. 22 to make sure that I could pull this off,” Page said. “I don’t want to be in a position where my county fails in some way to conduct a free and fair election.”

The county also started emailing people with past experience as election workers to gauge potential interest in working at a vote center during the special election.

California’s last special election

California last had a short-notice, off-year statewide special election in September 2021 when Newsom defeated an attempt to recall him from office.

But because the recall campaign was triggered by a signature drive rather than ordered by the state Legislature, Page said counties had plenty of early warning signs to help them prepare.

“We knew when there were enough signatures to require the recall election,” Page said. “We were very involved when the legislature was pitching ideas of trying to shorten the timeline and have the recall election in August of that year rather than September.”

Even then, when the Legislature was hashing out the fine print about when the election would take place, county registrars brought their vendors to testify that they didn’t have enough paper stock to print ballots in time for an August recall election. The date was ultimately set for Sept. 14.

How much will it cost?

The Legislature and the Department of Finance have yet to release official cost estimates for the statewide special election, but experts say that given inflation, the Nov. 4 special election will almost certainly surpass the recall’s price tag.

During that 2021 effort, the state sent counties more than $240 million and an additional $35 million to the secretary of state’s office to administer the election. In the end, the contest cost less than planned — about $200 million in all, with the counties’ costs totaling just over $174 million.

Newsom has repeatedly promised the state will cover the steep cost counties will incur to administer an unplanned statewide off-year election. Yet in the absence of official statewide numbers, county officials and even Assembly Republicans have released their own estimates. The GOP caucus’s budget analysis projected the statewide contest would cost taxpayers $235.5 million.

Page estimated Orange County’s costs will land somewhere between $11.2 million to $12.7 million depending on whether the ballot and county voter information guide will fit in the same envelope or need to be sent separately. Riverside County’s registrar projected upwards of $15 million in costs, and Fresno County was bracing for at least $4 million in unbudgeted expenses.

The counties have implored state leaders to provide them money up front rather than reimburse them after the election.

“The additional expenses tied to a statewide special election would fall almost entirely on counties — imposing a significant and unfunded financial burden on already strained local budgets,” wrote the California State Association of Counties, which represents county supervisors, in partnership with its subsidiary organization that represents clerks and registrars.

H.D. Palmer, spokesman for the Department of Finance, said that the legislation will provide the money to counties in advance, as it did in 2021 before the gubernatorial recall election, although the department has yet to determine the precise amount..

“The state of California is going to pay for it,” Newsom said at a press conference last week, dismissing concerns from county registrars about how they’d afford to administer the election as “deeply disingenuous.”

“There’s no price tag for democracy,” Newsom said.

The governor has also stated that unlike during the recall election, several counties already plan to hold local off-year elections and can add the redistricting question to the existing ballot. As of Monday, only 21 counties are listed as having elections scheduled for Nov. 4, according to the Secretary of State’s website.

But Cervantes, who estimates his county will incur at least $700,000 in additional costs, emphasized that it makes a “massive difference” whether the state pays upfront or requires counties to submit expenses for reimbursement. His vendors won’t allow him to defer payment until he receives the state’s check in the mail.

Cervantes noted that counties pay for elections administration from the same pot of money that funds sheriff’s departments, county jails and the district attorney’s offices, as well as some local wildfire prevention efforts. That’s why it’s so important for the state to cover the costs, he argued.

“You’re talking about taking deputies off the street. You’re talking about reducing social services. Like, it’s a zero-sum game,” Cervantes said. “If I have to spend that money, then other departments won’t be able to.”","Sentiment score -0.30000001192092896 , Sentiment Magnitude 22.100000381469727","name:Gavin Newsom type: 1 Salience 0.14454743266105652, name:California type: 2 Salience 0.047195736318826675, name:Juan Pablo Cervantes type: 1 Salience 0.03757042437791824, name:election type: 4 Salience 0.02832064777612686, name:counties type: 2 Salience 0.02270057424902916, name:state lawmakers type: 1 Salience 0.02251587063074112, name:County election officials type: 1 Salience 0.016062475740909576, name:Humboldt County type: 2 Salience 0.01443284098058939, name:Orange County type: 2 Salience 0.011932255700230598, name:Bob Page type: 1 Salience 0.011859485879540443, name:districts type: 2 Salience 0.011489151045680046, name:state type: 2 Salience 0.010660886764526367, name:Donald Trump type: 1 Salience 0.009757474064826965, name:midterm type: 4 Salience 0.009210124611854553, name:states type: 2 Salience 0.009074101224541664, name:county election official type: 1 Salience 0.00799097865819931, name:voters type: 1 Salience 0.00741041311994195, name:elections type: 4 Salience 0.007297838106751442, name:voting officials type: 1 Salience 0.006796450819820166, name:California State Association of Counties type: 3 Salience 0.005985899828374386","Category:/News/Politics , Category_confidence:99.0%"

https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-025-16458-8,"Datasets collection

To comprehensively verify the effectiveness and universality of the proposed algorithm, this study adopts two large-scale public MIDI datasets. First, the LAKH MIDI v0.1 dataset (https://colinraffel.com/projects/lmd/) is used as the main training data. It is a large-scale dataset containing over 170,000 MIDI files, and its rich melody, harmony, and rhythm materials provide a solid foundation for the model to learn music rules. In the data preprocessing stage, this study filters out piano music MIDI files from the LMD dataset because their melodic structures are clear, making them suitable as basic training materials for melody generation models.

However, to address the limitation of the LAKH MIDI dataset being dominated by piano music and test the model’s universality across a wider range of instruments, this study introduces a second multi-instrument dataset for supplementary verification. It adopts the MuseScore dataset (https://opendatalab.com/OpenDataLab/MuseScore), which is a large-scale, high-quality dataset collected from the online sheet music community MuseScore. The core advantage of this dataset lies in its great instrumental diversity, covering sheet music from classical orchestral music to modern band instruments (such as guitar, bass, drums) and various solo instruments. This provides an ideal platform for testing the model’s ability to generate non-piano melodies.

For both datasets, a unified preprocessing workflow is implemented:

1) Instrument Track Filtering: For the LAKH MIDI dataset, this study uses its metadata to filter out MIDI files with piano as the primary instrument. For the MuseScore dataset, which contains complex ensemble arrangements, it applies heuristic rules to extract melodic tracks: prioritizing tracks in MIDI files where the instrument ID belongs to melodic instruments (such as violin, flute, saxophone, etc.) and which have the largest number of notes and the widest range.

2) Note Information Extraction: This study uses Python’s mido library to parse each MIDI file. From the filtered tracks, it extracts four core attributes of each note: Pitch (i.e., MIDI note number, 0-127); Velocity (0-127); Start Time (in ticks); and Duration (in ticks).

3) Time Quantization and Serialization: To standardize rhythm information, it quantizes the start time and duration of notes to a 16th-note precision. This means discretizing the continuous time axis into a grid with 16th notes as the smallest unit, where all note events are aligned to the nearest grid point. All note events are strictly sorted by their quantized start time to form a time sequence.

4) Feature Engineering and Normalization: To eliminate mode differences, each melody is transposed to C major or a minor, allowing the model to focus on learning relative interval relationships rather than absolute pitches. Finally, each note event is encoded into a numerical vector. A typical vector might include: [normalized pitch, quantized duration, interval time from the previous note]. The sequence formed by these vectors serves as the final input to the model.

5) Data Splitting: All preprocessed sequence data are strictly divided into training and test sets in an 80%/20% ratio.

Experimental environment and parameters setting

To ensure the efficiency of the experiment and the reliability of the results, this paper has carefully designed the experimental environment and parameter settings. The experiment uses a high-performance computing cluster equipped with NVIDIA Tesla V100 GPUs to accelerate the model training process. This GPU has strong parallel computing capabilities and can effectively handle the computational burden brought by large-scale datasets. The model training is implemented based on the TensorFlow 2.0 framework, and Keras is used to construct and optimize the neural network structure. Due to the large scale of the LMD dataset, the training process requires a large amount of time and computational resources. Therefore, multi-GPU parallel computing technology is adopted in the experiment. Through multi-GPU parallel computing, the training time can be significantly shortened, and the experimental efficiency can be improved. In addition, the hyperparameters of the model have been carefully adjusted and optimized in the experiment to ensure that the model can achieve the best performance during the training process. Table 2 displays the parameter settings.

Table 2 Experimental parameter setting. Full size table

In hyperparameter tuning, a combination of Grid Search and manual fine-tuning based on validation set performance is adopted. The tuning method involved dividing 10% of the training set into a Validation Set, with the selection of all hyperparameters ultimately judged by the model’s F1 score on this validation set.

Search space and selection reasons for key hyperparameters:

1) Learning Rate: Searched within the range of [1e-3, 1e-4, 5e-5]. Experiments showed that a learning rate of 1e-3 led to unstable training with severe oscillations in the loss function, while 5e-5 resulted in excessively slow convergence. The final choice of 1e-4 achieved the best balance between convergence speed and stability.

2) Batch Size: Tested three options: [32, 64, 128]. A batch size of 128, though the fastest in training, showed slightly decreased performance on the validation set, possibly getting stuck in a poor local optimum. A batch size of 64 achieved the optimal balance between computational efficiency and model performance.

3) Number of LSTM Layers: Tested 1-layer and 2-layer LSTM networks. Results indicated that increasing to 2 layers did not bring significant performance improvement but instead increased computational costs and the risk of overfitting.

4) Number of Neurons: Tested hidden layer neuron counts in [128, 256, 512]. 256 neurons proved sufficient to capture complex dependencies in melodic sequences, while 512 neurons showed slight signs of overfitting.

5) Reward Function Weights: Tested weight ratios of artistic/technical aspects in [0.5/0.5, 0.7/0.3, 0.9/0.1]. Through subjective listening evaluation of generated samples, the ratio of 0.7/0.3 was deemed to best balance the melodic pleasantness and technical rationality.

Performance evaluation

To evaluate the performance of the constructed model, the proposed AC-MGME model algorithm is compared with the model algorithm proposed by DQN, MuseNet32, DDPG33 and Abouelyazid (2023), and the Accuracy, F1-score, and melody generation time are evaluated. The results in LAKH MIDI v0.1 dataset are shown in Figs. 4, 5 and 6.

Fig. 4 Accuracy results for music melody prediction by various algorithms in the LAKH MIDI v0.1 dataset. Full size image

Fig. 5 F1-score results for music melody prediction by various algorithms in the LAKH MIDI v0.1 dataset. Full size image

In Figs. 4 and 5, it can be found that on the LAKH MIDI dataset, the proposed AC-MGME model algorithm achieves the highest scores in both key indicators: accuracy (95.95%) and F1 score (91.02%). From the perspective of the learning process, although the Transformer-based State-of-the-Art (SOTA) model MuseNet shows strong competitiveness in the early stage of training, the AC-MGME model, relying on its efficient reinforcement learning framework, demonstrated greater optimization potential and successfully surpassed MuseNet in the later stage of training. This not only proves the superiority of its final results but also reflects its excellent learning efficiency. At the same time, AC-MGME maintained a leading position in all stages compared with other reinforcement learning-based comparison models (such as DDPG, DQN, etc.).

To more rigorously verify whether the leading advantage of the AC-MGME model in accuracy is statistically significant, a two-sample t-test is conducted on the results of each model in the final training epoch (Epoch 100). The significance level (α) adopted is 0.05, that is, when the p-value is less than 0.05, the performance difference between the two models is considered statistically significant, as shown in Table 3.

Table 3 Results of statistical significance test (t-test) for the final round (Epoch 100) accuracy and F1 score of AC-MGME model and each comparison model on LAKH MIDI v0.1 dataset. Full size table

In Table 3, the test results clearly demonstrate that the performance advantage of the AC-MGME model over all comparison models in terms of the key accuracy indicator is statistically significant. Specifically, even when compared with the powerful benchmark model MuseNet, its p-value (0.021) is far below the 0.05 significance threshold, and the differences from models such as DDPG and DQN are even more pronounced (p < 0.001). This conclusion is further confirmed by the F1 score, which more comprehensively reflects the model’s precision and recall. AC-MGME is also significantly superior to all comparison models in terms of F1 score (all p-values are less than 0.05). Overall, these statistical test results fundamentally rule out the possibility that the observed performance differences are caused by random factors. It provides solid and quantitative statistical evidence for the core assertion that the proposed AC-MGME model exhibits strong performance in both generation accuracy and comprehensive performance.

Figure 6 illustrates how the developed AC-MGME model outperforms previous contrast models in terms of melody creation time efficiency. From the figure, the generation time of AC-MGME decreases steadily with the progress of training, reaching the lowest value among all models at the 100th epoch, which is only 2.69 s. In sharp contrast, the Transformer-based SOTA model MuseNet maintains an inference time of over 6.2 s, highlighting the limitations of large-scale models in real-time applications. Meanwhile, the efficiency of AC-MGME is also significantly superior to all other reinforcement learning-based comparison models.

To further verify the superiority of the AC-MGME model in computational efficiency from a statistical perspective, a two-sample t-test is similarly conducted on the melody generation time of each model at the final epoch (Epoch 100), as shown in Table 4.

Table 4 Results table of statistical significance test (t-test) between AC-MGME model and each comparison model in the final round (Epoch 100) melody generation time. Full size table

In Table 4, in comparisons with all contrast models (including the heavyweight MuseNet and other reinforcement learning models), the p-values are all far less than 0.001. This extremely low p-value indicates that the shorter generation time exhibited by the AC-MGME model is not a random fluctuation in the experiment, but a significant advantage with high statistical significance. This finding provides decisive statistical evidence for the applicability of the model in real-time personalized music teaching applications that require rapid feedback.

To verify the generalization ability of the AC-MGME model in more complex musical environments, the final accuracy rates on the MuseScore dataset are compared, as shown in Fig. 7.

Fig. 7 Accuracy results for music melody prediction by various algorithms in the MuseScore dataset. Full size image

In Fig. 7, due to the significantly greater complexity and diversity of the MuseScore dataset in terms of instrument types and musical styles compared to the LAKH dataset, there is a universal decline in the accuracy of all models, which precisely reflects the challenging nature of this testing task. Nevertheless, the AC-MGME model once again demonstrats its strong learning ability and robustness, topping the list with an accuracy rate of 90.15% in the final epoch. It is particularly noteworthy that, in the face of complex musical data, the advantages of AC-MGME over other reinforcement learning models (such as DDPG and DQN) are further amplified. It successfully surpasses the powerful SOTA model MuseNet in the later stages of training. This result strongly proves that the design of the AC-MGME model is not overfitted to a single type of piano music, but possesses the core ability to migrate and generalize to a wider and more diverse multi-instrument environment, laying a solid foundation for its application in real and variable music education scenarios.

To verify whether the generalization ability of the AC-MGME model across a wider range of instruments is statistically significant, a two-sample t-test is similarly conducted on the accuracy results of each model at the final epoch (Epoch 100) on the MuseScore dataset, as shown in Table 5.

Table 5 AC-MGMEThe statistical significance test (t-test) results of the final accuracy of the model and the comparison model on the musescore dataset. Full size table

In Table 5, the test results indicate that the performance advantage of the AC-MGME model is statistically significant. Even in comparison with its strongest competitor, MuseNet, its p-value (0.042) is below the 0.05 significance level. While the differences from models such as Abouelyazid (2023), DDPG, and DQN are even more pronounced (p < 0.001). This strongly proves that the leading position of this model on diverse, multi-instrument datasets is not accidental. More importantly, this conclusion fundamentally confirms the robustness and generality of the AC-MGME framework, indicating that it is not limited to the generation of single piano melodies but can effectively learn and adapt to the melodic characteristics of a wider range of instruments, thus having application potential in more diverse music education scenarios.

To evaluate the deployment potential of the model in real teaching scenarios, a dedicated test on inference performance and hardware resource consumption is conducted. The model’s performance is assessed not only on high-performance servers but also deploys on a typical low-power edge computing device (NVIDIA Jetson Nano) to simulate its operation on classroom tablets or dedicated teaching hardware. The comparison of inference performance and resource consumption of each model on high-performance GPUs and edge devices is shown in Fig. 8.

Fig. 8 Comparison table of reasoning performance and resource occupation of each model on high-performance GPU and edge devices. Full size image

In Fig. 8, an analysis of the inference performance and resource consumption test reveals the significant advantages of the proposed AC-MGME model in practical deployment. In the high-performance GPU (NVIDIA Tesla V100) environment, AC-MGME not only demonstrated the fastest inference speed (15.8 milliseconds) but also had a GPU memory footprint (350 MB) far lower than all comparison models. Particularly when compared with the heavyweight Transformer model MuseNet (2850 MB), it highlighted the advantages of its lightweight architecture. More crucially, in the test on the low-power edge device (NVIDIA Jetson Nano) simulating real teaching scenarios, the average inference latency of AC-MGME was only 280.5 milliseconds, fully meeting the requirements of real-time interactive applications.

Two objective indicators, namely Pitch Distribution Entropy and Rhythmic Pattern Diversity, are further introduced to quantify the musical diversity and novelty of the generated melodies. This helps evaluate whether the model can generate non-monotonous and creative musical content. Among them, Pitch Distribution Entropy measures the richness of pitch usage in a melody. A higher entropy value indicates that the pitches used in the melody are more uneven and unpredictable, usually implying higher novelty. Rhythmic Pattern Diversity calculates the unique number of different rhythmic patterns (in the form of n-grams) in the melody. A higher value indicates richer variations in the rhythm of the melody. The comparison results and statistical analysis of the objective musicality indicators of the melodies generated by each model are shown in Table 6.

Table 6 Comparison and statistical significance test (t-test) results of pitch distribution entropy and rhythm diversity between AC-MGME model and each comparison model on musescore dataset. Full size table

Table 6 reveals the in-depth characteristics of each model in terms of musical creativity, and its results provide more inspiring insights beyond the single accuracy indicator. As expected, MuseNet, as a large-scale generative model, obtains the highest scores in both Pitch Distribution Entropy and Rhythmic Pattern Diversity, and statistical tests shows that its leading advantage is significant (p < 0.05), which proves its strong ability in content generation and innovation. However, a more crucial finding is that the AC-MGME model proposed in this study not only demonstrates highly competitive diversity but also significantly outperforms all other reinforcement learning-based comparison models in both indicators (p < 0.01). This series of results accurately indicates that the AC-MGME model proposed in this paper does not pursue unconstrained and maximized novelty, but rather achieves much higher musical diversity and creativity than similar DRL models on the premise of ensuring the rationality of musical structures. This good balance between “controllability” and “creativity” is an important reason why it obtained high scores in subsequent subjective evaluations, especially in “teaching applicability”.

To evaluate the subjective artistic quality and educational value that cannot be captured by technical indicators, a double-blind perception study is conducted. 30 music major students and 10 senior music teachers with more than 5 years of teaching experience are invited as expert reviewers. The reviewers score the melody segments generated by each model anonymously on a 1–5 scale (higher scores indicate better performance) without knowing the source of the melodies. The user feedback results under the proposed model algorithm are further analyzed, including the scores (1–5 points) in three aspects: the use experience, the learning effect and the quality of the generated melody. The comparison results with traditional music teaching and learning are shown in Fig. 9.

Fig. 9 Comparison chart of user feedback results. Full size image

In Fig. 9, according to the feedback from users, the satisfaction of AC-MGME model is higher than that of traditional music teaching. Especially in the aspect of melody quality, AC-MGME gets a high evaluation of 4.9 points, which is significantly better than the traditional teaching of 3.7 points. In addition, AC-MGME also performs well in terms of experience and learning effect, with scores of 4.8 and 4.6 respectively, far exceeding the scores of 3.6 and 3.9 in traditional teaching. This shows that AC-MGME model not only improves the learning effect and student experience, but also provides higher quality results in melody creation.

The expert evaluation results of subjective quality of melodies generated by each model are shown in Table 7, and the statistical analysis results are shown in Table 8.

Table 7 Subjective quality expert evaluation results of melodies generated by each model. Full size table

Table 8 Statistical significance test (t-test) results of subjective evaluation between AC-MGME model and each comparison model. Full size table

The results of Tables 7 and 8 show that, in the dimension of artistic innovation, MuseNet achieves the highest score with its strong generative capability, and its leading advantage is statistically significant (p = 0.008), which is completely consistent with the conclusion of the objective musicality indicators. However, in terms of melodic fluency, AC-MGME won with a slight but statistically significant advantage (p = 0.041), and expert comments generally considered its melodies to be “more in line with musical grammar and more natural to the ear”. The most crucial finding comes from the core dimension of teaching applicability, where the AC-MGME model obtained an overwhelming highest score (4.80), and its advantage over all models including MuseNet is highly statistically significant (p < 0.001). The participating teachers pointed out that the melodies generated by AC-MGME are not only pleasant to listen to, but more importantly, “contain clear phrase structures and targeted technical difficulties, making them very suitable as practice pieces or teaching examples for students”. This series of findings strongly proves that while pursuing technical excellence, this model more accurately meets the actual needs of music education, and can generate educational resources that combine artistic quality and practical value. This is a unique advantage that cannot be matched by models that simply pursue novelty or accuracy.

Discussion

The results of this study clearly demonstrate the comprehensive advantages of the AC-MGME model across multiple dimensions. In terms of objective performance, the model not only outperforms all comparison benchmarks, including state-of-the-art models, in accuracy and F1 score, but also confirms the reliability of this advantage through strict statistical significance tests (p < 0.05). More importantly, in the subjective quality evaluation, AC-MGME achieved an overwhelming highest score in “teaching applicability”, indicating that it does not simply pursue technical indicators, but precisely meets the core needs of music education—generating musical content that combines structural rationality, artistic fluency, and teaching practical value. In addition, through deployment tests on low-power edge devices, this study is the first to empirically prove that while ensuring high-quality generation, the model has great potential for efficient and low-latency deployment in real classroom environments, laying a solid foundation for its transition from theory to application.

This study indicates that the proposed AC-MGME model exhibits significant performance in terms of melody generation quality, learning effectiveness, and user experience. In terms of melody generation quality, the AC-MGME model scores 4.9/5, which is higher than that of traditional music teaching, demonstrating its strong ability to generate melodies with both artistic and technical merits. Meanwhile, AC-MGME also performs well in learning effectiveness, with a score of 4.6/5, which is higher than traditional teaching, proving its effectiveness in generating personalized learning paths and improving students’ skills. In terms of user experience, AC-MGME scores 4.8/5, also higher than traditional teaching (3.6/5), further verifying the advantages of the interactive and convenient teaching system based on DRL. This is consistent with the findings of Dadman et al. (2024)34 and Udekwe et al. (2024)35. Particularly in terms of generation time, AC-MGME only takes 2.69 s to generate a melody, while other models such as DQN require 8.54 s. AC-MGME not only improves the generation quality but also significantly enhances the generation efficiency. In addition, the model performs excellently in terms of generation quality (with an accuracy rate of 95.95% and an F1 score of 91.02% on the LAKH MIDI dataset), and its generation quality is higher than that of other tested models, supporting the feasibility of real-time applications. This is consistent with the research of Chen et al. (2024)36.

Therefore, the proposed model algorithm can efficiently generate melody and provide personalized learning experience. By dynamically adjusting the melody generation strategy, AC-MGME can optimize the generated content in real time according to students’ different needs and learning progress, which greatly improves the intelligence and personalization level of music education and provides valuable practical basis for the development of AI-driven music education tools in the future.

However, while affirming these achievements, people must carefully recognize the limitations and potential biases in the research. Firstly, in terms of datasets, although the introduction of the MuseScore dataset has greatly expanded the diversity of instruments, the content of both datasets still mainly focuses on Western tonal music. This may lead to poor performance of the model when generating non-Western music or modern atonal music, resulting in an “over-representation” bias in a broader cultural context. Secondly, the size of the user sample is also a limiting factor. Although the expert review panel composed of 40 music professionals has provided valuable in-depth insights, this scale is not sufficient to fully represent the diverse perspectives of global music educators and learners. Therefore, although the results of this study are robust within the test framework, caution is still needed when generalizing them to all music cultures and educational systems, and more localized verifications should be conducted.

Finally, the application of such AI technologies in the field of education will inevitably raise ethical issues that require serious attention. A core concern is the potential risk of abuse, particularly music plagiarism. The model may learn and reproduce copyrighted melody segments during training, thereby triggering intellectual property issues. To mitigate this risk, future system iterations must integrate plagiarism detection algorithms, for example, by comparing generated content with n-gram sequences in the training set, and design corresponding reward mechanisms to encourage originality. Another equally important ethical issue is the privacy and security of student data. While tracking and analyzing students’ practice data can enable personalized teaching, it also involves sensitive personal performance information. To address this, strict data management strategies must be adopted, including anonymizing and aggregating all data, ensuring system design complies with relevant regulations such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), and fully disclosing the content, purpose, and usage of data collection to students, parents, and teachers. These measures aim to build a trustworthy and responsible intelligent music education ecosystem.","Sentiment score 0.20000000298023224 , Sentiment Magnitude 67.0","name:AC-MGME type: 3 Salience 0.18233129382133484, name:https://opendatalab.com/OpenDataLab/MuseScore type: 6 Salience 0.024714041501283646, name:MuseNet type: 3 Salience 0.016727935522794724, name:models type: 6 Salience 0.003670918056741357, name:melody generation models type: 6 Salience 0.003655301872640848, name:model type: 1 Salience 0.0036471164785325527, name:image type: 5 Salience 0.003571941051632166, name:note events type: 4 Salience 0.003273077541962266, name:unit type: 2 Salience 0.0026242707390338182, name:piano music type: 1 Salience 0.00257479096762836, name:music type: 5 Salience 0.002565694274380803, name:instruments type: 6 Salience 0.0018451882060617208, name:band instruments type: 6 Salience 0.0018386669689789414, name:sheet music type: 5 Salience 0.001587730715982616, name:piano type: 6 Salience 0.0014671280514448881, name:range type: 6 Salience 0.001465557492338121, name:tracks type: 5 Salience 0.0013824875932186842, name:epoch type: 2 Salience 0.001380317029543221, name:note event type: 4 Salience 0.0012799336109310389, name:NVIDIA type: 3 Salience 0.0011228978401049972","Category:/Science/Computer Science , Category_confidence:70.0%"

Two members of the Fulton County, Georgia Board of Commissioners defied a court order and blocked the appointment of two election deniers to the county board of elections.

During Wednesday’s board of commissioner’s meeting, District 3 Commissioner Dana Barrett and District 4 Commissioner Mo Ivory, both Democrats, voted against appointing Republicans Julie Adams and Jason Frazier to the board. In May, the Board of Commissioners voted 5-2 to reject Adams’ and Frazier’s nominations — but the county Republican party sued claiming the board violated state law by rejecting their nominations.

Earlier this month, a state court found that the Board of Commissioners did not have the authority to reject Adams and Frazier and ordered it to appoint the duo to the county board of elections during its next meeting.

The Board of Commissioners appealed the court’s ruling, but their request to temporarily pause the order was denied.

At the end of Wednesday’s meeting, only four of the board’s seven commissioners remained to vote, resulting in a 2-2 deadlock vote in appointing Adams and Frazier.

In an email to Democracy Docket prior to the meeting, Barrett said she was planning to vote against the appointments despite the court order.

“I am a no and will risk contempt charges and fines or jail to defend democracy,” Barrett wrote.

It is unclear what consequences Barrett and Ivory will face for defying the court’s order. Last week, Fulton Republicans asked the court to hold the board in contempt for refusing to appoint Adams and Frazier. A state court judge had reserved his ruling on the GOP’s motion pending today’s meeting.

“A Petition for Contempt of Judge Emerson’s Order should be filed immediately and I hope the Judge will consider not only a fine but jail time for the unlawful defiance of a lawful court order,” Josh McKoon, chairman of the Georgia Republican Party, wrote on X.

In a statement, Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffesperger (R) called the board’s vote “reckless” and said they must follow the court order, but stopped short of calling for a fine or jail time.

“The actions of the commissioners undermine trust in government,” Raffensperger said. “I call on the Fulton Commission to follow the rule of law and appoint all bipartisan appointees, not just the ones they prefer.”

“This is a red-alert moment for democracy in Georgia,” said Fair Fight CEO Lauren Groh-Wargo. “Unelected Republican Party operatives are trying to dictate how elected Fulton County Commissioners vote, exploiting contradictions in state law and municipal code to seat extremist activists. Adams and Frazier are bad-faith actors and, if appointed, we expect they will undermine and try to break the very election system they’re supposed to uphold and improve. What happens here today will echo nationwide.”

Adams, who previously served on the board, refused to certify the county’s 2024 primary election results, claiming she didn’t have access to all information about the voting process. She also has ties to the Cleta-Mitchell-led Election Integrity Network (EIN) and the right-wing Tea Party Patriots.

Frazier also has a long history of election controversy. Frazier has challenged nearly 10,000 voter registrations in Fulton County and claims to have successfully challenged over 25,000. In August 2024, he filed a lawsuit against the election board, falsely claiming that they failed to properly maintain the county’s voter rolls and respond to voter challenges. The lawsuit was voluntarily dismissed a month later.

“When elected officials obstruct the law and openly defy a judge’s lawful order, accountability at this point is essential,” the Fulton County GOP posted on X minutes after the board’s vote to block Adams’ and Frazier’s appointment, tagging the U.S. Department of Justice in their post.

“It’s not about partisan politics, it is about ensuring our Board of Elections are held to the highest level of accountability, and that our elections are fair,” Ivory said before she voted to block Adams’ and Frazier’s appointments.

“They’re election deniers and they’re doing everything they can to undermine faith in our elections,” Barrett said before casting her vote.

toggle caption David Sharp/AP

The Trump administration has indicated it may withhold tens of millions of dollars in election security funding if states don't comply with its voting policy goals.

The money comes from a Department of Homeland Security (DHS) grant program, and voting officials say new requirements from the administration will make the money inaccessible for most of the country.

NPR is the first news outlet to report on the changes.

About $28 million — or 3% of the overall Homeland Security Grant Program — is devoted to election security and now at risk, though some officials and experts worry that the new requirements could also endanger hundreds of millions of dollars in other grants for law enforcement.

Sponsor Message

Voting officials say the amount of money at risk won't make or break the country's election security. But the potential withholding of funds over policy differences — combined with other recent election security cuts — has many wondering whether the Trump administration is prioritizing election security the way it claims it is.

""Despite the rhetoric, there's been [a] serious cutback to election security support that is being offered to the states,"" said Larry Norden, an elections expert at the Brennan Center for Justice, which is broadly critical of President Trump's policies. ""And this is going to be one more cut for a lot of states because most states are not going to allow the president to decide [how their elections work].""

The grant money in question is administered within DHS by the Federal Emergency Management Agency, or FEMA, and is meant to help state and local governments prepare for and prevent terrorism and disasters. For some of the grants, DHS designates priority areas to further target what the money is spent on, and three years ago the agency began designating election security as one of those priorities.

This year, however, Trump directed DHS to adjust the election security portion of the grants as part of his March 25 executive order on voting (much of which has been paused by courts).

The new grant rules were released publicly in late July, and multiple election officials told NPR they saw them similar to that executive order: as a way for the administration to try to force their hands when it comes to policy.

""The Department of Homeland Security is trying to back-door changes to our election laws,"" said Maine Secretary of State Shenna Bellows, a Democrat. ""That is unacceptable.""

The grant applications closed earlier this month, and Maine is forgoing roughly $130,000 in election security grant money because the state does not plan to comply with the new requirements, Bellows said.

Another state election official, who spoke to NPR anonymously because they did not have permission to speak publicly, said their state was also forgoing the money. They estimated that only a handful of election offices were working with their state emergency management departments to craft the grant applications in line with the new election requirements and therefore would potentially access that money.

The new requirements

It's also unclear exactly how DHS will judge whether states meet the new demands.

One of the requirements, for instance, is that jurisdictions applying for money must ""prioritize compliance"" with federal guidelines for voting system certification that are so new they have not yet been incorporated anywhere in the country.

In a statement provided to NPR after publication, FEMA did not answer NPR's specific questions about the new grant rules, including about how such a provision would be adjudicated considering that no state is currently using election equipment certified to the new standards.

""We encourage states with questions to work with their state election offices for basic implementation requirements,"" FEMA said. ""If any state is not found to be compliant, we reserve the right to withhold funding or terminate the grants.""

Another new requirement is that jurisdictions applying for election security money must use a new DHS citizenship verification tool for all people working at a polling place in ""any capacity.""

That tool, known as the SAVE system, was expanded rapidly by DHS this year, and the agency has not disclosed anything publicly about the accuracy or reliability of the information provided by the system, or about how personal data run through the system will be secured.

It's unclear whether the system has ever been used to verify election workers, considering the functionality that allows the system to search for U.S.-born citizens was only added in the past few months.

""DHS can't require us to use that system,"" said Bellows.

Concerns about other law enforcement grants

NPR has previously reported that in previous years some of the grant program's money designated for election security has not actually gone to reinforcing state voting infrastructure.

That election security portion of the grants represents a small percentage of the overall billion-dollar DHS grant program, but Norden of the Brennan Center is concerned the rest of the grant money could also be withheld if states don't comply with the elections rules.

In the section of the new election requirements, there is a line that says an applying jurisdiction must ""demonstrate proof of compliance before accessing the full"" award. Norden called the line unclear and alarming.

""You are talking about a billion dollars for state and local law enforcement to protect Americans from terrorism,"" Norden said. ""The idea that that money ... could be in any way held up is alarming for anybody who cares about the safety and security of citizens.""

At the end of the new election grant requirements, there was one more change from the 2024 rules. Language that explicitly banned using grant money for activities that ""could be used to suppress voter registration or turnout"" was removed.","Sentiment score -0.30000001192092896 , Sentiment Magnitude 18.200000762939453","name:DHS type: 3 Salience 0.31069332361221313, name:administration type: 3 Salience 0.12154734879732132, name:NPR type: 3 Salience 0.0445321686565876, name:Trump type: 1 Salience 0.033748723566532135, name:Brennan Center for Justice type: 3 Salience 0.022326244041323662, name:Larry Norden type: 1 Salience 0.020828673616051674, name:states type: 2 Salience 0.016680603846907616, name:election officials type: 1 Salience 0.009863687679171562, name:officials type: 1 Salience 0.0067909155040979385, name:country type: 2 Salience 0.005470287054777145, name:experts type: 1 Salience 0.004965357482433319, name:millions type: 1 Salience 0.004965357482433319, name:toggle caption type: 1 Salience 0.0044214436784386635, name:state type: 3 Salience 0.004385811742395163, name:state election official type: 1 Salience 0.004103776998817921, name:Shenna Bellows type: 1 Salience 0.003931768704205751, name:David Sharp type: 1 Salience 0.0026144369039684534, name:AP type: 3 Salience 0.0026144369039684534, name:elections type: 4 Salience 0.0025415716227144003, name:voting officials type: 1 Salience 0.0024310394655913115","Category:/News/Politics , Category_confidence:73.0%"

However, thanks to California’s proactive efforts to defend its values against the federal administration, the state and ultimately the people have been able to recoup at least $168 billion in federal funding. This effort is a direct result of the special session to safeguard Californians earlier this year – so far spending $5 million to support the litigation, representing a 3,360,000% (3.4 million percent) return on investment.","Sentiment score -0.30000001192092896 , Sentiment Magnitude 5.300000190734863","name:California type: 2 Salience 0.257858544588089, name:legislation type: 5 Salience 0.1366882622241974, name:Robert Rivas type: 1 Salience 0.13585075736045837, name:bystander type: 1 Salience 0.0515020526945591, name:Trump type: 1 Salience 0.0353425033390522, name:state type: 2 Salience 0.03141993656754494, name:D-Salinas type: 1 Salience 0.02497776225209236, name:attacks type: 4 Salience 0.020312730222940445, name:Mike McGuire type: 1 Salience 0.010866580531001091, name:voters type: 1 Salience 0.009630905464291573, name:Proclamation type: 4 Salience 0.0017881019739434123, name:Newsom type: 1 Salience 0.007069939281791449, name:Californians type: 1 Salience 0.0069267931394279, name:Californian type: 1 Salience 0.0067567117512226105, name:election type: 4 Salience 0.006509394850581884, name:people type: 1 Salience 0.006401943974196911, name:folks type: 1 Salience 0.0047667790204286575, name:millions type: 1 Salience 0.0047667790204286575, name:House type: 3 Salience 0.004544239956885576, name:administration type: 3 Salience 0.004454217851161957","Category:/News/Politics , Category_confidence:94.0%"
https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/what-to-know-about-trumps-bid-for-the-u-s-government-to-own-a-piece-of-intel,"In his second term, Trump has been leveraging his power to reprogram the operations of major computer chip companies. The administration is requiring Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices, two companies whose chips are helping to power the craze around artificial intelligence, to pay a 15% commission on their sales of chips in China in exchange for export licenses.

The Trump administration is in talks to secure a 10% stake in Intel in exchange for converting government grants that were pledged to Intel under President Joe Biden. If the deal is completed, the U.S. government would become one of Intel’s largest shareholders and blur the traditional lines separating the public sector and private sector in a country that remains the world’s largest economy.

SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — President Donald Trump wants the U.S. government to own a piece of Intel, less than two weeks after demanding the Silicon Valley pioneer dump the CEO that was hired to turn around the slumping chipmaker. If the goal is realized, the investment would deepen the Trump administration’s involvement in the computer industry as the president ramps up the pressure for more U.S. companies to manufacture products domestically instead of relying on overseas suppliers.

Trump’s interest in Intel is also being driven by his desire to boost chip production in the U.S., which has been a focal point of the trade war that he has been waging throughout the world. By lessening the country’s dependence on chips manufactured overseas, the president believes the U.S. will be better positioned to maintain its technological lead on China in the race to create artificial intelligence.

Didn’t Trump want Intel’s CEO to quit?

That’s what the president said August 7 in an unequivocal post calling for Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan to resign less than five months after the Santa Clara, California, company hired him. The demand was triggered by reports raising national security concerns about Tan’s past investments in Chinese tech companies while he was a venture capitalist. But Trump backed off after Tan professed his allegiance to the U.S. in a public letter to Intel employees and went to the White House to meet with the president, who applauded the Intel CEO for having an “amazing story.”

Why would Intel do a deal?

The company isn’t commenting about the possibility of the U.S. government becoming a major shareholder, but Intel may have little choice because it is currently dealing from a position of weakness. After enjoying decades of growth while its processors powered the personal computer boom, the company fell into a slump after missing the shift to the mobile computing era unleashed by the iPhone’s 2007 debut.

Intel has fallen even farther behind in recent years during an artificial intelligence craze that has been a boon for Nvidia and AMD. The company lost nearly $19 billion last year and another $3.7 billion in the first six months of this year, prompting Tan to undertake a cost-cutting spree. By the end of this year, Tan expects Intel to have about 75,000 workers, a 25% reduction from the end of last year.

Would this deal be unusual?

Although rare, it’s not unprecedented for the U.S. government to become a significant shareholder in a prominent company. One of the most notable instances occurred during the Great Recession in 2008 when the government injected nearly $50 billion into General Motors in return for a roughly 60% stake in the automaker at a time it was on the verge of bankruptcy. The government ended up with a roughly $10 billion loss after it sold its stock in GM.

Would the government run Intel?

U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick told CNBC during a Tuesday interview that the government has no intention of meddling in Intel’s business, and will have its hands tied by holding non-voting shares in the company. But some analysts wonder if the Trump administration’s financial ties to Intel might prod more companies looking to curry favor with the president to increase their orders for the company’s chips.

What government grants does Intel receive?

Intel was among the biggest beneficiaries of the Biden administration’s CHIPS and Science Act, but it hasn’t been able to revive its fortunes while falling behind on construction projects spawned by the program.

The company has received about $2.2 billion of the $7.8 billion pledged under the incentives program — money that Lutnick derided as a “giveaway” that would better serve U.S. taxpayers if it’s turned into Intel stock. “We think America should get the benefit of the bargain,” Lutnick told CNBC. “It’s obvious that it’s the right move to make.”","Sentiment score -0.30000001192092896 , Sentiment Magnitude 14.300000190734863","name:government type: 3 Salience 0.4772365093231201, name:Intel type: 3 Salience 0.11682531237602234, name:Donald Trump type: 1 Salience 0.09368611872196198, name:U.S. type: 2 Salience 0.036278434097766876, name:administration type: 3 Salience 0.020490987226366997, name:computer chip companies type: 3 Salience 0.012994724325835705, name:Joe Biden type: 1 Salience 0.009767518378794193, name:CEO type: 1 Salience 0.001036069355905056, name:term type: 4 Salience 0.006356899626553059, name:companies type: 3 Salience 0.006267253775149584, name:Lip-Bu Tan type: 1 Salience 0.004824773408472538, name:country type: 2 Salience 0.004105806816369295, name:company type: 3 Salience 0.004033243283629417, name:one type: 1 Salience 0.0036677345633506775, name:commission type: 3 Salience 0.0034788174089044333, name:president type: 1 Salience 0.0033929087221622467, name:talks type: 4 Salience 0.0030411446932703257, name:pioneer type: 3 Salience 0.002919631078839302, name:venture capitalist type: 1 Salience 0.002771209692582488, name:China type: 2 Salience 0.0017087481683120131","Category:/Business & Industrial , Category_confidence:62.0%"

toggle caption David Paul Morris/Bloomberg via Getty Images

President Trump said on Friday he had asked Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan for a 10% stake in the company during a recent meeting at the White House.

""He agreed, and they've agreed to do it, and I think it's a great deal for them,"" Trump told reporters. ""He walked in wanting to keep his job, and he ended up giving us $10 billion for the United States,"" Trump said.

In a statement released on the company's website late Friday afternoon, Intel confirmed that the government would make an $8.9 billion investment in Intel common stock ""reflecting the confidence the Administration has in Intel to advance key national priorities and the critically important role the company plays in expanding the domestic semiconductor industry.""

Sponsor Message

Part of the government's stake, worth $5.7 billion, would be funded by grants awarded, but not yet paid, to the company under the CHIPS and Science Act, the 2022 law that authorized a total of nearly $53 billion in government funding for chip-related activities. Intel said it already received $2.2 billion in CHIPS grants, making a total investment of $11.1 billion.

Another $3.2 billion will be awarded to the company as part of the Defense Department's Secure Enclave program, which funds semiconductor manufacturing in the U.S.

The company's statement said that under the terms of the deal, the government has agreed to purchase 433.3 million primary shares of Intel common stock at $20.47 per share, equivalent to a 9.9% stake in the company. The government will have no board representation or other ""governance or information rights,"" according to the statement, and the government agreed to vote with the company's board on matters requiring shareholder approval, with limited exceptions.

On Truth Social, Trump called it a ""great Deal for America and, also, a great Deal for INTEL. Building leading edge Semiconductors and Chips, which is what INTEL does, is fundamental to the future of our Nation.""

The deal is a highly unusual step — it marks an escalation in the Trump administration's efforts to push chipmakers to manufacture in the United States, and a new milestone in how willing CEOs are to cede the president an unprecedented amount of control over their companies.

Earlier this week, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick previewed the deal in an interview on CNBC . ""So we'll deliver the money, which was already committed under the Biden administration. We'll get equity in return for it,"" Lutnick said.

After Trump's remarks Friday afternoon, Lutnick posted on X that the U.S. ""now owns 10% of Intel,"" and he called it a ""historic agreement.""

Intel, once a leader in chip production, has faced a raft of problems in recent years.

It has stumbled in the race to feed soaring data center demand for chips used to build artificial intelligence models known as graphics processing units, or GPUs. The leader in that field is Intel's Santa Clara, California-based neighbor Nvidia, now the world's biggest company with a market capitalization of over $4 trillion.

(Earlier in August, Trump announced that Nvidia would pay the U.S. government 15% of its revenues of H20 chip sales in China in exchange for being allowed to sell them there. An Nvidia spokesperson declined to comment to NPR on the 15% figure, and in a statement, the company said it follows ""rules the U.S. government sets for our participation in worldwide markets."")

Intel's revenue has fallen in recent years, driving its market capitalization down. This year, the company reported net losses for the first two quarters.

President Trump took direct aim at Intel CEO Tan earlier this month, calling on him to resign following reports he invested in a range of Chinese tech companies. Days later, Tan went to the White House for a face-to-face meeting with the president, after which Trump called the meeting ""interesting"" and Tan a ""success.""

Intel is planning to invest more than $28 billion in two chip production facilities in Ohio, but the plans have been delayed and analysts say it is unclear if there will be sufficient demand for the chips the company eventually produces.

""One of the questions that we still haven't seen answers to yet in the public sphere, at least, is how this discussion about equity financing relates to the question of who's going to be the customer for Intel's factories that are being built and their processes or their manufacturing processes that are being brought online,"" said Chris Miller, a professor at Tufts University and the author of Chip War: The Fight for the World's Most Critical Technology.

""That's a key part of the puzzle,"" he said, adding it was too early to know if a potential equity deal would be a boon for Intel or complicate the company's efforts to try to lead the field again.","Sentiment score -0.10000000149011612 , Sentiment Magnitude 9.300000190734863","name:Intel type: 3 Salience 0.5018234252929688, name:Trump type: 1 Salience 0.12439756840467453, name:government type: 3 Salience 0.0527624748647213, name:U.S. type: 2 Salience 0.03174808621406555, name:company type: 3 Salience 0.021286576986312866, name:Lip-Bu Tan type: 1 Salience 0.014404202811419964, name:edge Semiconductors type: 6 Salience 0.005566313397139311, name:statement type: 5 Salience 0.00505863456055522, name:neighbor type: 1 Salience 0.004702574573457241, name:meeting type: 4 Salience 0.00426733773201704, name:toggle caption type: 1 Salience 0.0034370117355138063, name:Nvidia type: 3 Salience 0.0030344233382493258, name:Howard Lutnick type: 1 Salience 0.0028763406444340944, name:reporters type: 1 Salience 0.002783796051517129, name:Defense Department type: 3 Salience 0.0026177193503826857, name:White House type: 3 Salience 0.00039963171002455056, name:CEOs type: 1 Salience 0.0021589742973446846, name:David Paul Morris type: 1 Salience 0.002032367279753089, name:Getty Images type: 3 Salience 0.002032367279753089, name:Bloomberg type: 3 Salience 0.002032367279753089","Category:/Business & Industrial , Category_confidence:68.0%"

US TV network Newsmax has agreed to pay $67m (£50m) to settle a defamation lawsuit filed by a voting machine company over false claims it rigged the 2020 US election against President Donald Trump. Dominion, which filed the case in 2021, had accused Newsmax of broadcasting ""verifiably false lies"" following President Joe Biden's victory, causing ""devastating economic harm"" to the firm. The conservative network announced on Monday that it had settled, but maintained its coverage was fair and balanced. Dominion, which had sought £1.6bn in damages, said it was ""pleased to have settled this matter"". The Denver-based firm filed similar lawsuits in the aftermath of the 2020 election.

Delaware Superior Court Judge Eric Davis had already ruled in this case that Newsmax did defame Dominion. But the judge left it to a jury to determine whether Newsmax acted with malice, and how much in damages to award. The trial had been due to begin in October. Newsmax said it chose to settle because it argued the proceedings were unfair. ""From the very beginning, Judge Davis ruled in ways that strongly favored the plaintiffs and limited Newsmax's ability to defend itself,"" Newsmax said. The network said a ""pattern of judicial rulings"" had denied Newsmax due process and ""left the company to believe it would not receive a fair trial"". The Delaware Superior Court declined to comment.

https://calmatters.org/politics/2025/08/california-redistricting-things-to-know/,"In summary California has an overwhelmingly Democratic delegation in Congress. Gov. Newsom’s plan could give his party five more seats and offset a Texas gerrymander.

The fight over redistricting is about to hit overdrive in California.

As the Legislature returns to Sacramento today for the final month of session, Democrats are racing to finish a plan that could tilt the state’s congressional map in their favor — and thrust California into another confrontation with President Donald Trump.

Republicans, who stand to lose more than half their seats in the state, decry the scheme as a self-serving power grab. But supporters, led by Gov. Gavin Newsom, contend they are saving democracy by stopping Trump from rigging the outcome of the 2026 midterms.

Ultimately, California voters will likely decide in a special election this November.

Here’s what you need to know:

Wait, what is Newsom trying to do?

The governor is leading the charge for the Democratic response in a burgeoning partisan showdown that could effectively determine control of the U.S. House of Representatives before a single vote is cast next November.

This kicked off thousands of miles away from Sacramento — in Texas. Earlier this year, Trump began pressuring Republican leaders there to redraw its congressional lines to shore up the GOP’s narrow majority in the House. As his approval rating sinks, the president is worried Democrats could win back Congress in the 2026 election and disrupt the final two years of his term.

Even as dozens of Democratic members have fled the state in protest, the Texas Legislature is advancing a new map that could flip five Democratic House seats to Republican control. Other conservative states, including Ohio, Missouri, Indiana and Florida, are considering similar actions.

So, channeling the anger of Democratic voters, Newsom has launched California into a retaliatory redistricting that would offset the Texas map with five new Democratic-leaning seats.

“Donald Trump, you have poked the bear and we will punch back,” Newsom said during a rally last week formally kicking off the campaign. “Don’t mess with the great Golden State.”

How would it work?

It’s complicated!

Unlike Texas, where the Legislature determines congressional lines, California voters in 2010 gave that power to a bipartisan citizen commission. The commission draws a new map once each decade, after the U.S. Census, to ensure each congressional district has roughly an equal number of people. It last did so in 2021.

Newsom is proposing to temporarily override the commission and create districts more favorable to Democrats until after the 2030 Census. That requires going to the voters for their approval.

Democratic officials already drew a new map in secret, which they finally shared publicly on Friday. The Legislature, where three-quarters of members are Democrats, plans to vote before the end of this week to put that map on the ballot in a statewide special election on Nov. 4.

“Voters will see the maps and have the final say,” Assembly Speaker Robert Rivas, a Salinas Democrat, said in a statement.

Why the rush?

California’s primary election is in June, so work backwards from there. The deadline for candidates to declare is in early March. Those who want to collect signatures to qualify, instead of paying a filing fee, can start in December.

That means new congressional lines need to be in place by the end of the year, so candidates actually know which voters they need to reach.

Newsom is eyeing Nov. 4 for the special election to consolidate it with municipal elections across the state that day. State law requires elections officials to mail a ballot to every voter starting 29 days before the election, and to military and overseas voters 45 days before, which means ballots must be ready by late September.

The secretary of state’s office has said the Legislature must act by Friday to leave enough time for local elections officials to meet those deadlines for a Nov. 4 election. Even then, the next month will be extremely busy for them.

How much will this cost?

The state has promised to cover the expenses counties incur running this unexpected election, which won’t be cheap. The last state special election, an unsuccessful recall of Newsom in September 2021, cost about $200 million.

Newsom has said consolidating the election with already scheduled local elections on Nov. 4 could save money. But early estimates from counties — up to $4 million in Fresno and up to $16 million in Riverside — are higher than they were for the recall.

“No price tag for democracy,” Newsom told reporters last week following the kickoff rally.

Will this plan succeed?

Democrats feel good about their chances, but it’s a heavy lift.

A Politico poll found that nearly two-thirds of California voters prefer retaining the state’s independent redistricting commission over returning authority to the Legislature to draw congressional lines.

That is not exactly what Newsom’s plan would do, however. His messaging has emphasized that the commission would only be sidelined temporarily, because of what he calls a Trump-induced political emergency. It’s reflected in the name of the measure: the Election Rigging Response Act. Internal polling shared with lawmakers put support, when framed along those lines, at 52%.

While that’s enough to win in November, it may not be enough to withstand an intense campaign this fall that is expected to draw hundreds of millions of dollars in spending. Charles Munger, Jr., the longtime Republican donor who poured more than $12 million into the campaign to pass independent redistricting, has said he will open up his wallet again to defend it.

“Citizens, not politicians or partisan party insiders, should not only hold the power at the ballot box but also the power to draw the lines,” Amy Thoma Tan, a spokesperson for Munger’s campaign committee, said in a statement.

The National Republican Congressional Committee said in a statement that it was prepared to “fight Gavin Newsom’s illegal power grab in the courts and at the ballot box.”","Sentiment score -0.30000001192092896 , Sentiment Magnitude 18.399999618530273","name:California type: 2 Salience 0.09571001678705215, name:Gavin Newsom type: 1 Salience 0.06358709931373596, name:Democratic type: 3 Salience 0.037088535726070404, name:election type: 4 Salience 0.036770645529031754, name:Republicans type: 3 Salience 0.030613578855991364, name:Texas Legislature type: 3 Salience 0.030446166172623634, name:voters type: 1 Salience 0.028153693303465843, name:supporters type: 1 Salience 0.025592796504497528, name:Texas type: 2 Salience 0.01955115795135498, name:president type: 1 Salience 0.013625740073621273, name:delegation type: 1 Salience 0.012750627472996712, name:Congress type: 3 Salience 0.01231694407761097, name:Charles Munger, Jr. type: 1 Salience 0.012082778848707676, name:state type: 2 Salience 0.011799607425928116, name:campaign type: 4 Salience 0.008445188403129578, name:fight type: 4 Salience 0.00733034685254097, name:party type: 3 Salience 0.00706053338944912, name:session type: 4 Salience 0.006915166974067688, name:Gov. type: 1 Salience 0.0068808007054030895, name:map type: 5 Salience 0.006776341237127781","Category:/News/Politics , Category_confidence:99.0%"
https://www.pbs.org/newshour/show/why-the-federal-government-could-take-a-stake-in-intel,"Peter Harrell:

No, I think there are questions about legally how they are going to structure this.

So, if we look back, back in 2022, so three or four years ago now, Congress appropriated money for the CHIPS Act. The CHIPS Act had actually preceded getting money. Congress appropriated money. And then the Commerce Department went through a period of giving grants, which are clearly authorized by the CHIPS Act, to a range of companies, including Intel, including a company called TSMC, which is a Taiwanese company, including Samsung and others, to give those companies incentives to build semiconductors here in the U.S.

And the reason that the government didn't take ownership in those companies then was really twofold. First, there's a question about whether it's legal. But, second, these are companies — these are not — this is not a bailout situation. These are companies that had been making chips very profitably overseas, and the government wants them to do it here.

And had the government said, we're going to take equity in you if you come to the United States, the companies just would have said, thanks, but no thanks. We're fine manufacturing in Taiwan and Singapore and Korea and places like that. So I don't think that taking equity is really about — very helpful to getting the companies to onshore.

Now, Intel is a little bit different because Intel over the last couple of years has had some serious technological problems, some serious business problems. Again, we still have to get through, is this really legal? And I think it would be helpful for the Trump administration to spell out its legal rationale, because it was definitely not originally contemplated in the CHIPS Act.","Sentiment score -0.20000000298023224 , Sentiment Magnitude 6.400000095367432","name:companies type: 3 Salience 0.10552671551704407, name:company type: 3 Salience 0.09957070648670197, name:Intel type: 3 Salience 0.07810347527265549, name:CHIPS Act type: 5 Salience 0.05847429111599922, name:Peter Harrell type: 1 Salience 0.04458468407392502, name:Congress type: 3 Salience 0.031812310218811035, name:government type: 3 Salience 0.026909247040748596, name:administration type: 3 Salience 0.01951204426586628, name:semiconductors type: 6 Salience 0.015369775705039501, name:Commerce Department type: 3 Salience 0.010800228454172611, name:others type: 1 Salience 0.00917605496942997, name:TSMC type: 3 Salience 0.006366189103573561, name:U.S. type: 2 Salience 0.0054254536516964436, name:Taiwanese type: 2 Salience 0.0054254536516964436, name:Samsung type: 3 Salience 0.0036148775834590197, name:manufacturing type: 4 Salience 0.0027930147480219603, name:places type: 2 Salience 0.0027930147480219603, name:Trump type: 1 Salience 0.0026255003176629543, name:Singapore type: 2 Salience 0.0016503243241459131, name:Korea type: 2 Salience 0.0016503243241459131","Category:None , Category_confidence:0%"
https://calmatters.org/politics/2025/08/california-redistricting-vote/,"In summary Many California Democrats are reluctant to give up the state’s independently drawn congressional districts, but they say it’s a necessary step to counter gerrymanders in Republican states.

Gov. Gavin Newsom’s plan to counter President Donald Trump’s election gerrymander in Texas with his own redistricting play in California is on its way to voters.

The California Legislature today approved his proposal calling for a special election on a ballot measure that would suspend the state’s current congressional districts, which were drawn by an independent commission, and replace them with a map intended to favor Democrats.

The Assembly passed the measure 57 to 20, and lawmakers on the floor erupted in applause even before they closed the vote. The Senate passed it hours later on a party-line vote, 30-8. Newsom declared a Nov. 4 special election shortly afterward.

At a press conference to promote the upcoming campaign for what will appear on the ballot as Proposition 50, he said it was time for Democrats to “play hardball” in response to the Trump administration’s moves to “advance their power.”

“We tried to hold hands and talk about the way the world should be,” he said. “We can’t just think differently, we have to act differently.”

California voters in a 2010 ballot measure backed independent redistricting for congressional districts, a process meant to cultivate fair, competitive elections. Democrats say they’re reluctant to give up that system, even temporarily, but believe they have to in order to counter Trump’s bid to retain control of Congress after 2026.

“If unaddressed, Texas’ actions – which occur without the vote of the populace – will disenfranchise California,” said Assemblymember Josh Lowenthal, a Long Beach Democrat whose father had pushed for nonpartisan redistricting as a state lawmaker and Congressman.

“It’s imperative that Californians have a voice in selecting the political party that controls Congress in 2026,” said Lowenthal in an emotional speech from the floor before the vote. “So today, I proudly join with my father, the architect of this commission, in urging its temporary suspension.”

Republicans before the vote pleaded with their colleagues to resist following Texas in the race to the gerrymandering bottom.

“There’s really only one way to stop – someone has to refrain from striking back, and show a better way,” said Assemblymember James Gallagher, Republican of Chico and the minority leader.

Lawmakers on Thursday also passed a bill containing the new congressional map voters will be asked to approve, sending it to Newsom’s desk, and an additional bill that will facilitate and fund the special election. Newsom signed both of them today.

The change is intended to be temporary; the measure that will go before voters requires the state to return to nonpartisan map-drawing after the 2030 census.

Newsom wanted to counter Texas

Newsom kicked off the special election scramble after Trump declared that he was “entitled” to five more GOP congressional seats in Texas. He demanded that Lone Star State lawmakers shore up Republicans’ razor thin, three-seat House majority by redrawing their congressional maps mid-decade. When Gov. Greg Abbott indicated Texas would redistrict, Newsom said California would retaliate.

Democrats today hold 43 of the state’s 52 congressional seats. The Newsom-backed maps transform five Republican seats into districts that heavily favor Democrats. By ousting those incumbents, Newsom would effectively essentially cancel out Trump’s effort in Texas. The maps also strengthen Democrats’ hold on three other competitive California districts, making it harder for the GOP to flip them next year.

California Republican lawmakers spent the week throwing up a variety of procedural blocks to try to stop the bills’ fast-tracked progress through the legislature, including by asking the California Supreme Court to weigh in on their challenge to the short time between the legislation’s public release on Monday and their final vote on the Assembly and Senate floors on Thursday.

They demanded an end to the redistricting arms race nationwide, with some willing to condemn Texas and other red states that Trump has urged to redraw their maps.

They argued that Newsom’s maps unfairly split some communities into multiple congressional districts, and that some Democratic lawmakers were biased given their reported personal interest in running for Congress.

In particularly acrimonious spells on the Senate and Assembly floors, the two parties sparred over who had started the fight. Republicans, accused of insufficient opposition to the Trump administration, in turn argued Democratic lawmakers were overly loyal to Newsom.

GOP couldn’t stall measure

But Republican efforts to derail the measure ran up against both political numbers and longtime legislative practice in California.

Polling shows most Democratic voters want the party to do more to fight the Trump administration. In the past few weeks, Democratic lawmakers, who command a three-quarters supermajority in both chambers, have overwhelmingly fallen in line behind Newsom on the redistricting effort.

Every year, lawmakers regularly reveal last-minute deals that they fast-track for passage 72 hours later, in a way that nominally complies with state constitutional requirements.

The timing of the votes may be litigated, but California Republicans have already lost in court once. The state Supreme Court on Wednesday night declined to take up the GOP’s timing-based challenge to the map-drawing effort.

GOP lawmakers acknowledged they’ll likely have to fight the issue at the polls.

“We will defeat this, if it’s not here in the Capitol, it will be in a courtroom or it will be at the ballot box,” Assemblymember Alexandra Macedo said this week.","Sentiment score -0.30000001192092896 , Sentiment Magnitude 17.700000762939453","name:Gavin Newsom type: 1 Salience 0.29147759079933167, name:California type: 2 Salience 0.044875845313072205, name:districts type: 2 Salience 0.029954683035612106, name:Republican type: 3 Salience 0.025139786303043365, name:lawmakers type: 1 Salience 0.021188179031014442, name:Democrats type: 1 Salience 0.017497891560196877, name:state type: 2 Salience 0.017031073570251465, name:states type: 2 Salience 0.017031073570251465, name:Texas type: 2 Salience 0.013901435770094395, name:voters type: 1 Salience 0.008409359492361546, name:measure type: 5 Salience 0.00736644770950079, name:Capitol type: 2 Salience 0.007122798357158899, name:election type: 4 Salience 0.006867500487715006, name:floor type: 2 Salience 0.006514620501548052, name:map type: 5 Salience 0.006167909130454063, name:commission type: 3 Salience 0.00574361439794302, name:Josh Lowenthal type: 1 Salience 0.005621299147605896, name:proposal type: 5 Salience 0.005369639489799738, name:architect type: 1 Salience 0.00445694662630558, name:party type: 3 Salience 0.004251678939908743","Category:/News/Politics , Category_confidence:99.0%"

How the NCAA is attempting to solve the problems that prop bets present (1:08)

Open Extended Reactions

The NCAA said Thursday that it was ""deeply concerned"" about the lack of guardrails for the online prediction markets that are challenging betting industry norms after financial company Robinhood began allowing trades on college football.

Robinhood announced Tuesday that it was launching markets on the outcomes of professional and college football games this season. The company said in a release that it will allow customers to trade on the outcomes of every NFL game and every college game involving schools from the Power 4 conferences and independents. A market on the winner of Saturday's Iowa State-Kansas State game was open for trading Thursday night. Robinhood also offered a market on the Heisman Trophy winner.

Robinhood's move is in partnership with the financial exchange Kalshi, which earlier in the week began offering trading on college football point spreads and over/under totals on its own site. Prediction markets have emerged over the past year and are competing with traditional sportsbooks such as DraftKings and FanDuel in the evolving U.S. betting market.

Robinhood and Kalshi say they fall under the jurisdiction of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, a federal agency, and not state gambling regulators, which oversee the sportsbooks.

The NCAA believes companies offering markets on college athletics outside of state regulatory bodies ""pose a threat to competition integrity and student-athlete safety,"" according to a statement by Tim Buckley, a senior vice president for the NCAA.

""We will continue to analyze developments of this market and work with industry leaders to help ensure guardrails and regulations to protect NCAA competition, student-athletes, coaches and officials,"" Buckley said.

Robinhood vice president JB Mackenzie told ESPN that the company believes the federal regulations they operate under provide the necessary guardrails.

""Federal regulations provide important customer protections and market integrity safeguards, and we do not believe that these event contracts threaten competition integrity or student-athlete safety,"" he said.

The rise of prediction markets, with their nationwide access, has prompted DraftKings and FanDuel, the two leading sportsbook companies, to position themselves to enter the sector. FanDuel announced this week that it was partnering with CME Group, a derivatives marketplace, to ""develop new fully funded, event-based contracts with defined risk.""

Robinhood filed a suit this week against gambling regulators in New Jersey and Nevada to prevent the states from taking action to block their sports markets. Kalshi is also in the middle of legal battles with state regulators in multiple states. For now, the companies continue to offer event contracts on sports outcomes as football season kicks off.","Sentiment score 0.0 , Sentiment Magnitude 5.699999809265137","name:college athletes type: 1 Salience 0.0846794843673706, name:company type: 3 Salience 0.04611245542764664, name:NCAA type: 3 Salience 0.03292574733495712, name:FanDuel type: 3 Salience 0.022378701716661453, name:Robinhood type: 1 Salience 0.021712522953748703, name:state gambling regulators type: 3 Salience 0.015385515056550503, name:Dan Wetzel type: 1 Salience 0.014630746096372604, name:JB Mackenzie type: 1 Salience 0.012953385710716248, name:sportsbook companies type: 3 Salience 0.011876702308654785, name:college football games type: 4 Salience 0.008012205362319946, name:game type: 4 Salience 0.007994275540113449, name:Tim Buckley type: 1 Salience 0.007398863788694143, name:season type: 4 Salience 0.006805518176406622, name:customers type: 1 Salience 0.006790282670408487, name:companies type: 3 Salience 0.006200590170919895, name:statement type: 5 Salience 0.0059952265582978725, name:release type: 4 Salience 0.005964869167655706, name:schools type: 3 Salience 0.005964869167655706, name:trading type: 4 Salience 0.005384089425206184, name:winner type: 1 Salience 0.004572657402604818","Category:/Sports/Fantasy Sports , Category_confidence:55.0%"

His remarks shook up rate-cut bets, which had been waning after a weak monthly jobs report. Traders on Friday were pricing in about 91.5% odds of a September cut compared to 70% earlier in the morning and 85% a week ago.

Meanwhile, the 10-year (^TNX) and 30-year (^TYX) Treasury yields fell after Powell's remarks. The commentary also spurred a gain in bitcoin (BTC-USD) and other cryptocurrencies, with ethereum (ETH-USD) leading the crypto gains.

The White House watched Powell's speech closely, as President Trump has continued to push the Fed and Powell to lower rates. Trump opened a new front in his public pressure campaign on central bank independence by calling for the resignation of Fed governor Lisa Cook for alleged mortgage fraud. On Friday, Trump said he'll ""fire"" Cook if she doesn't resign, though legally, presidents cannot easily dismiss Fed governors.

On the earnings front, Zoom (ZM) stock popped Friday after reporting an AI boost, and Ross Stores (ROST) jumped as shoppers sought discounts amid tariffs. Intuit (INTU) and Workday (WDAY), meanwhile, slid.

Shares of Intel (INTC) jumped 5% after President Trump said the government will take a 10% stake in the ailing chip giant, calling it a ""great deal.""

https://finance.yahoo.com/news/what-is-the-bottom-line-for-the-stock-market-185741175.html,"According to Goldman Sachs research published last Sunday, U.S. businesses are currently eating most of the incremental costs from higher tariffs, which are a headwind for profit margins.

The hot July Producer Price Index report suggests that tariffs are causing inflation to heat up. (More on that below in TKer’s weekly review of the macro crosscurrents.)

This is notable as we have yet to understand the full effects of new tariffs, which most experts agree will prove costly.

Analysts’ earnings outlook is largely driven by expectations for high and even rising profit margins .

Indeed, this bullish outlook for earnings continues to be the simplest explanation for why the stock market is holding up.

For investors, it’s appropriate that the figurative bottom line — the effect of a risk on earnings — and the literal bottom line — earnings — both speak to TKer Stock Market Truth No. 5 : Earnings drive stock prices.

Wall Street analysts agree. And their 12-month, 24-month, and 36-month outlooks for earnings confirm this optimism.

Q2 earnings season is mostly wrapped up. And the message from Corporate America has been clear: Uncertainty is high given all the risks, but the outlook for earnings growth is promising.

The bottom line is whether companies will continue to deliver on earnings targets despite the challenges.

In these discussions about emerging risks, the risks themselves are not the bottom line.

But what many often underestimate is Corporate America’s ability to evolve and adapt to challenges in its ruthless pursuit of earnings growth.

Over and over again, we’ve read about how various risks would subtract from earnings. (Read more here .)

However, all else is never equal.

All else equal , any of these risks presents headwinds to sales and/or costs.

With the stock market today, I find that both the figurative and literal usages of the ""bottom line"" help me organize discussions about why prices are at record highs.

The term originally came from accounting . On an income statement, the top line is revenue. As you move down the income statement, you see costs of goods, expenses, interest, taxes, and other items, all of which you subtract from revenue. What you’re left with after all those adjustments is earnings, which fall to the bottom line.

The ""bottom line"" is colloquially used as a metaphor to refer to "" the essential or salient point "" of a discussion.

Story Continues

Businesses are currently absorbing most of the tariff costs. That’s expected to shift to consumers down the road. (Source: Goldman Sachs)

The analysts expect consumers to eventually bear most of the costs through higher prices. This isn’t great for future demand.

Will the bullish outlook for margins fall apart and bring down earnings estimates? We’ll see.

It’s worth noting that many market watchers have been expecting hot inflation and cooling demand to pressure margins since 2021. And yet, high margins persisted through to 2022, 2023, and 2024. And they’re expected to improve in 2025.

Maybe Corporate America will surprise skeptics yet again.

Zooming out 🔭

You should be mindful of developments that could harm the earnings prospects of the companies you invest in.

However, explorations of these issues should ultimately be grounded in what they mean for earnings, as earnings are the most important driver of stock prices. That’s the bottom line.

Review of the macro crosscurrents 🔀

There were several notable data points and macroeconomic developments since our last review:

👎 Consumer price inflation ticks higher. The Consumer Price Index (CPI) in July was up 2.7% from a year ago. Adjusted for food and energy prices, core CPI was up 3.1%, up from the prior month’s 2.9% rate.

On a month-over-month basis, CPI was up 0.2% and core CPI increased 0.3%. If you annualize the three-month trend in the monthly figures — a reflection of the short-term trend in prices — core CPI climbed 2.8%.

👎 Wholesaler price inflation jumps. The Producer Price Index (PPI) in July was up 3.3% from a year ago. Adjusted for food and energy prices, core PPI was up 3.7%, up from the prior month’s 2.6% rate.

On a month-over-month basis, both PPI and core PPI were up 0.9%.

From Bloomberg’s Michael McDonough: ""Tariffs raise import costs, and wholesalers/retailers often hike markups to protect profits — pushing PPI ‘services’ higher. Less foreign competition can also lift U.S.-made goods prices, so both goods and services PPI can climb even without stronger demand.""

⛽️ Gas prices barely budge. From AAA: ""No news is good news for drivers as gas prices stayed on track this past week, with the national average returning to $3.16 after a few dips. The summer of lower pump prices continues, as the busy driving season nears its end. As we enter peak hurricane season, storms affecting gas production and distribution are something to keep an eye on. But right now, with crude oil prices remaining steady, there’s no indication gas prices will make any drastic moves.""

💼 New unemployment claims tick lower — but total ongoing claims are elevated. Initial claims for unemployment benefits declined to 224,000 during the week ending Aug. 9, down from 227,000 the week prior. This metric remains at levels historically associated with economic growth.

(Source: DoL via FRED)

Insured unemployment, which captures those who continue to claim unemployment benefits, declined to 1.953 million during the week ending Aug. 2. This metric is near its highest level since November 2021.

(Source: DoL via FRED)

Steady initial claims confirm that layoff activity remains low. Rising continued claims confirm hiring activity is weakening. This dynamic warrants close attention, as it reflects a deteriorating labor market.

🛍️ Shopping ticks higher. Retail sales increased 0.5% in July to a record $726.3 billion.

Most categories saw growth.

💳 Card spending data is holding up. From JPM: ""As of 07 Aug 2025, our Chase Consumer Card spending data (unadjusted) was 5.2% above the same day last year.""

(Source: JPMorgan)

From BofA: ""Total card spending per HH was up 3.5% y/y in the week ending Aug 9, according to BAC aggregated credit & debit card data. Entertainment saw the biggest y/y spending gain while dept. stores saw the biggest drop vs last week, across our categories. This continued pickup in total y/y spending growth is consistent with our view that the economy might be re-accelerating.""

(Source: BofA)

👎 Consumer sentiment deteriorates. From the University of Michigan’s August Surveys of Consumers: ""Consumer sentiment fell back about 5% in August, declining for the first time in four months. This deterioration largely stems from rising worries about inflation. Buying conditions for durables plunged 14%, its lowest reading in a year, on the basis of high prices. Current personal finances declined modestly amid growing concerns about purchasing power.""

""Year-ahead inflation expectations rose from 4.5% last month to 4.9% this month. This increase was seen across multiple demographic groups and all three political affiliations. Long-run inflation expectations also lifted from 3.4% in July to 3.9% in August. This month ended two consecutive months of receding inflation for short-run expectations and three straight months for long-run expectations.""

Relatively weak consumer sentiment readings appear to contradict resilient consumer spending data.

🏠 Mortgage rates tick lower. According to Freddie Mac, the average 30-year fixed-rate mortgage declined to 6.58% from 6.63% last week. From Freddie Mac: ""Mortgage rates fell to their lowest level since October. Purchase application activity is improving as borrowers take advantage of the decline in mortgage rates.""

There are 147.9 million housing units in the U.S., of which 86.1 million are owner-occupied and about 39% are mortgage-free. Of those carrying mortgage debt, almost all have fixed-rate mortgages, and most of those mortgages have rates that were locked in before rates surged from 2021 lows. All of this is to say: Most homeowners are not particularly sensitive to the small weekly movements in home prices or mortgage rates.

For more on mortgages and home prices, read: Why home prices and rents are creating all sorts of confusion about inflation 😖

🛠️ Industrial activity cools. Industrial production activity in July decreased 0.1% from the prior month's levels. Manufacturing output was unchanged.

For more on economic activity cooling, read: 9 once-hot economic charts that cooled 📉

👍 Small business optimism ticks higher. The NFIB’s July Small Business Optimism Index rose to 100.3 in July from 98.6 in June. From the NFIB: ""While uncertainty is still high, the next six months will hopefully offer business owners more clarity, especially as owners see the results of Congress making the 20% Small Business Deduction permanent and the final shape of trade policy. Meanwhile, labor quality has become the top issue on Main Street again.""

😬 This is the stuff pros are worried about. From BofA’s August Global Fund Manager Survey: ""Trade war triggering a global recession remained the #1 'tail risk' ... Sentiment on what would be the biggest 'tail risk' was more broadly spread in August.""

(Source: BofA)

(Source: BofA)

🏢 Offices remain relatively empty. From Kastle Systems: ""Peak day office occupancy was 63.1% on Tuesday last week, down four tenths of a point from the previous week. Most tracked cities experienced decreases throughout the week, as workers take more time away from the office as the summer vacation season winds down. The average low was on Friday at 34%, down two tenths of a point from the previous week.""

📈 Near-term GDP growth estimates are tracking positively. The Atlanta Fed’s GDPNow model sees real GDP growth rising at a 2.5% rate in Q3.

Putting it all together 📋

🚨 The Trump administration’s pursuit of tariffs threatens to disrupt global trade, with significant implications for the U.S. economy, corporate earnings, and the stock market. Until we get more clarity, here’s where things stand:

Earnings look bullish: The long-term outlook for the stock market remains favorable, bolstered by expectations for years of earnings growth. And earnings are the most important driver of stock prices.

Demand is positive: Demand for goods and services remains positive, supported by healthy consumer and business balance sheets. Job creation, although cooling, also remains positive, and the Federal Reserve — having resolved the inflation crisis — shifted its focus toward supporting the labor market.

But growth is cooling: While the economy remains healthy, growth has normalized from much hotter levels earlier in the cycle. The economy is less ""coiled"" these days as major tailwinds like excess job openings and core capex orders have faded. It has become harder to argue that growth is destiny.

Actions speak louder than words: We are in an odd period, given that the hard economic data decoupled from the soft sentiment-oriented data. Consumer and business sentiment has been relatively poor, even as tangible consumer and business activity continues to grow and trend at record levels. From an investor’s perspective, what matters is that the hard economic data continues to hold up.

Stocks are not the economy: There’s a case to be made that the U.S. stock market could outperform the U.S. economy in the near term, thanks largely to positive operating leverage. Since the pandemic, companies have aggressively adjusted their cost structures. This came with strategic layoffs and investment in new equipment, including hardware powered by AI. These moves are resulting in positive operating leverage, which means a modest amount of sales growth — in the cooling economy — is translating to robust earnings growth.

Mind the ever-present risks: Of course, we should not get complacent. There will always be risks to worry about, such as U.S. political uncertainty, geopolitical turmoil, energy price volatility, and cyber attacks. There are also the dreaded unknowns. Any of these risks can flare up and spark short-term volatility in the markets.

Investing is never a smooth ride: There’s also the harsh reality that economic recessions and bear markets are developments that all long-term investors should expect as they build wealth in the markets. Always keep your stock market seat belts fastened.

Think long-term: For now, there’s no reason to believe there’ll be a challenge that the economy and the markets won’t be able to overcome over time. The long game remains undefeated, and it’s a streak that long-term investors can expect to continue.

The S&P 500 (^GSPC) fell just below flatline, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) declined nearly 0.1%, coming off a second straight winning week for the major gauges. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) eked out slight gains.

Geopolitics were front of mind on Monday as Volodymyr Zelensky and European allies spoke with President Trump in Washington, D.C., with the Ukrainian president facing US pressure to accept a peace deal that favors Russia. The meeting follows Trump's encounter with his Russian counterpart, Vladimir Putin, at their Alaska summit.

But markets are also looking ahead to the main event this week, Jerome Powell's comments at the Jackson Hole symposium on Friday. His speech — likely to be Powell's last as Fed chair — will be closely followed for clues to the path of monetary policy, after inflation and retail data prompted Wall Street to temper rate cut hopes last week. The annual gathering of central bankers often brings signals of key shifts in Fed thinking, and its policymakers are facing a dilemma over what action to take.

The release of minutes from the Fed's July meeting on Wednesday will set the stage for Jackson Hole in a week light on economic data.

Meanwhile, second quarter earnings season is winding down, with Palo Alto Networks (PANW) and Blink Charging (BLNK) reports on Monday's docket. With most of the reports in, the results have been mostly positive. Highly anticipated earnings from Walmart (WMT), Target (TGT), Home Depot (HD), and Lowe's (LOW) are due later in the week, likely to provide insights into consumer spending.

Shares of Intel (INTC) fell after Bloomberg reported the Trump administration was contemplating a 10% stake in the chipmaker. Last week, shares jumped after reports that Trump was considering using funds from the CHIPS Act to invest in the company.

CHAMPAIGN, Ill. – Illinois has unveiled its completed 2025-26 non-conference schedule, highlighted by five games against high-major opponents who competed in the 2025 NCAA Tournament and featuring a trio of reigning Elite Eight participants.

After hosting Illinois State in an exhibition game on Sunday, Oct. 19, the Fighting Illini officially tip off the season at home on Nov. 3, facing Jackson State on opening night.

That begins a four-game homestand followed by Florida Gulf Coast on Friday, Nov. 7, a marquee contest at State Farm Center against returning Elite Eight squad Texas Tech on Nov. 11, and wrapping up with Colgate on Friday, Nov. 14, the night before Illinois Football's home game against Maryland.

On Nov. 19, Illinois heads to Chicago to play a regular season non-conference game at the United Center for the first time since 2017, taking on Elite Eight participant Alabama.

The Illini then return to Champaign for a pair of games, versus Long Island on Saturday, Nov. 22 and UT-Rio Grande Valley on Nov. 24.

Illinois will play at Madison Square Garden for the fourth consecutive season, going up against UConn on Black Friday, Nov. 28, in New York City. UConn won back-to-back NCAA Championships in 2023 and 2024, and advanced to the Round of 32 last season.

Following a home-and-home series with Tennessee, Illinois has signed an additional two-game agreement with the Vols. It begins with a contest this season in Nashville on Saturday, Dec. 6, where the Illini will face the reigning Elite Eight team.

The Illini are in St. Louis on Dec. 22, battling Missouri in the annual McBride Homes Braggin' Rights game. Illinois will look to retain the Braggin' Rights trophy for the third year in a row against the Tigers, who are coming off an NCAA Tournament appearance.

Illinois closes out the calendar year at home against Southern on Dec. 29.

Illinois' Big Ten home schedule includes the following 10 teams: Indiana, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, Nebraska, Northwestern, Oregon, Rutgers, Washington and Wisconsin.

The Illini will make league road trips, meanwhile, to Iowa, Maryland, Michigan State, Nebraska, Northwestern, Ohio State, Penn State, Purdue, UCLA and USC.

The full Big Ten schedule will be released at a later date.

Illinois returns three starters from a 22-win campaign, NCAA Tournament Second Round appearance, and final kenpom ranking of 17th last season. The Fighting Illini are the winningest team in Big Ten play over the last six years of the Underwood era and stand as one of just four teams nationally with six straight 20-win regular seasons.","Sentiment score 0.0 , Sentiment Magnitude 2.9000000953674316","name:Fighting Illini type: 3 Salience 0.2794586420059204, name:Illinois type: 2 Salience 0.1925654411315918, name:opponents type: 1 Salience 0.040737684816122055, name:games type: 4 Salience 0.025938035920262337, name:exhibition game type: 4 Salience 0.02584713324904442, name:Illinois State type: 3 Salience 0.0236516036093235, name:participants type: 1 Salience 0.01829494908452034, name:Ill type: 1 Salience 0.0161599013954401, name:trio type: 1 Salience 0.014940420165657997, name:Elite Eight type: 1 Salience 0.01275334320962429, name:CHAMPAIGN type: 2 Salience 0.011936684139072895, name:homestand type: 3 Salience 0.009918472729623318, name:home type: 2 Salience 0.009824344888329506, name:season type: 4 Salience 0.009461886249482632, name:Texas Tech type: 3 Salience 0.008845863863825798, name:NCAA Tournament type: 4 Salience 0.007082963827997446, name:marquee contest type: 4 Salience 0.00689858291298151, name:home game type: 4 Salience 0.0066133663058280945, name:Jackson State type: 3 Salience 0.005363121163100004, name:Championships type: 4 Salience 0.005129395052790642","Category:/Sports/College Sports , Category_confidence:96.0%"

It's August and no games have been played, but that's not keeping ESPN's college football reporters from predicting the 12 schools that will make up the College Football Playoff beginning in December.

Allstate Playoff Predictor How will this season's top games affect the College Football Playoff chase? What are the current odds for the top four? The Allstate Playoff Predictor has the answers. Check back every week as the odds are updated following that week's games.

Ohio State won the inaugural 12-team bracket last season, despite starting as the No. 8 seed, demonstrating that the playoff truly gives new life to any team that gains entry.

There's a slight alteration to the format this year. The tournament will still comprise the top five conference champions and seven at-large schools. But the top four seeds -- and the first-round bye that comes with each of those seeds -- will no longer go to the four highest-ranked conference champions (last season that was Oregon, Georgia, Boise State and Arizona State). This season the committee has moved to a straight seeding model, so the four highest-ranked schools in the committee's final top 12 will get the top four seeds.

Ahead of Week 0, here are the slates our reporters picked. Let the chase begin:

https://www.wired.com/story/why-did-a-10-billion-dollar-startup-let-me-vibe-code-for-them-and-why-did-i-love-it/,"Sitting a few feet away was Simon Last, one of Notion’s three cofounders. He is gangly and shy, an engineer who has relinquished management responsibilities to focus on being a “super IC”—an individual contributor. He stood to shake my hand, and I awkwardly thanked him for letting me vibe-code. Simon returned to his laptop, where he was monitoring an AI as it coded for him. Later, he would tell me that using AI coding apps was like managing a bunch of interns.

Since 2022, the Notion app has had an AI assistant to help users draft their notes. Now the company is refashioning this as an “agent,” a type of AI that will work autonomously in the background on your behalf while you tackle other tasks. To pull this off, human engineers need to write lots of code.

They open up Cursor and select which of several AI models they’d like to tap into. Most engineers I chatted with during my visit preferred Claude, or they used the Claude Code app directly. After choosing their fighter, the engineers ask their AI to draft code to build a new thing or fix a feature. The human programmer then debugs and tests the output as needed—though the AIs help with this too—before moving the code to production.

At its foundational core, generative AI is enormously expensive. The theoretical savings come in the currency of time, which is to say, if AI helped Notion’s cofounder and CEO Ivan Zhao finish his tasks earlier than expected, he could mosey down to the jazz club on the ground floor of his Market Street office building and bliss out for a while. Ivan likes jazz music. In reality, he fills the time by working more. The fantasy of the four-day workweek will remain just that.

My workweek at Notion was just two days, the ultimate code sprint. (In exchange for full access to their lair, I agreed to identify rank-and-file engineers by first name only.) My first assignment was to fix the way a chart called a mermaid diagram appears in the Notion app. Two engineers, Quinn and Modi, told me that these diagrams exist as SVG files in Notion and, despite being called scalable vector graphics, can’t be scaled up or zoomed into like a JPEG file. As a result, the text within mermaid diagrams on Notion is often unreadable.

Quinn slid his laptop toward me. He had the Cursor app open and at the ready, running Claude. For funsies, he scrolled through part of Notion’s code base. “So, the Notion code base? Has a lot of files. You probably, even as an engineer, wouldn’t even know where to go,” he said, politely referring to me as an engineer. “But we’re going to ignore all that. We’re just going to ask the AI on the sidebar to do that.”

His vibe-coding strategy, Quinn explained, was often to ask the AI: Hey, why is this thing the way it is? The question forces the AI to do a bit of its own research first, and the answer helps inform the prompt that we, the human engineers, would write. After “thinking,” Cursor informed us, via streaming lines of text, that Notion’s mermaid diagrams are static images that, among other things, lack click handlers and aren’t integrated with a full-screen infrastructure. Sure.","Sentiment score 0.0 , Sentiment Magnitude 12.699999809265137","name:Simon Last type: 1 Salience 0.42851388454437256, name:Cursor type: 1 Salience 0.00048487677122466266, name:human engineers type: 1 Salience 0.022347796708345413, name:AI type: 3 Salience 0.016246316954493523, name:laptop type: 6 Salience 0.015589018352329731, name:cofounders type: 1 Salience 0.012854859232902527, name:engineers type: 1 Salience 0.00998616125434637, name:mermaid diagrams type: 5 Salience 0.007001908961683512, name:Quinn type: 1 Salience 0.006312470883131027, name:contributor type: 1 Salience 0.005438751075416803, name:users type: 1 Salience 0.005184086970984936, name:app type: 6 Salience 0.0029690193478018045, name:Ivan Zhao type: 1 Salience 0.002789633348584175, name:AI coding apps type: 6 Salience 0.002062081592157483, name:interns type: 1 Salience 0.0020368709228932858, name:agent type: 1 Salience 0.002028457587584853, name:company type: 3 Salience 0.002028457587584853, name:workweek type: 4 Salience 0.001617479370906949, name:fighter type: 1 Salience 0.0015967233339324594, name:engineer type: 1 Salience 0.0015754711348563433","Category:/Arts & Entertainment , Category_confidence:57.0%"

https://www.binghamton.edu/news/story/5725/binghamton-student-faculty-team-wins-50000-in-suny-startup-competition,"Creating a business is usually not part of the plan for faculty members and researchers. But Assistant Professor Jayson Boubin now hopes to commercialize his work on specialized cameras for drones, thanks to encouragement from the Office of Entrepreneurship and Innovation Partnerships (EIP).

Boubin and Melika Dastranj, PhD ’28, participated in the SUNY Summer Startup School (S4) this summer and took home the grand prize of $50,000 as the winner of Demo Day.

S4, in its sixth year, has grown to include 222 SUNY students, faculty and staff from 30 SUNY campuses. Fifteen teams pitched their innovations to a full room at Demo Day, which was a new experience for Boubin.

“Lately, when you’re applying for funding or a grant, it’s less about written applications and more of you pitching your tech in a closed room to a small group,” said Boubin, a faculty member at the Thomas J. Watson College of Engineering and Applied Science’s School of Computing. “Getting to watch everyone’s pitches, seeing everyone’s reactions and having a room full of encouragement was so energizing.”

At S4 Demo Day, Boubin was amazed at the other pitches and the advances being made across SUNY.

“My colleague, [SUNY Empire Innovation Professor] Nancy Guo, is doing such advanced work in AI diagnostics for cancer; she did an incredible job,” he said. “I was also blown away by a student from SSIE [Watson’s School of Systems Science and Industrial Engineering], Rommel Trotman — he was inspired to create Balance Socks, a balance-sensing tech that monitors patients’ stability to help assess and prevent falls. It was inspired by his mother’s experience as a nurse in a hospital.”

S4 has been incorporated as one of the components of Binghamton’s Excellence in Entrepreneurship and Discovery (EXCEED) Pre-Accelerator Program, which is supported by a National Science Foundation Accelerating Research Translation (ART) grant.

Kathryn Cherny, PhD ’18, manages the ART grant and its various EXCEED programs with the goal of increasing translational research capacity impacts. These impacts are seen through increasing patent filings and licensing, connecting to industry for use-inspired research, supporting spinout companies and advancing a culture of entrepreneurship and innovation reflected by including research translation in promotion and tenure guidelines.

“Boubin is an incredible researcher who was able to take a very complex technology and communicate the importance and impact to a non-scientific audience in seven minutes,” said Cherny. “That is a honed skill, just like grant writing, and incredibly hard to do well. This success exemplifies the idea behind EXCEED, which is with strategic support, training, and funding we can accelerate the translation of our faculty’s incredible innovations to real-world impacts.”

REMIX, Boubin’s company, aims to simplify this technology enough that anyone with a Federal Aviation Administration license could attach it to a drone and process the necessary data for individual use.

“The ‘RE’ in our company name stands for ‘Real Time’” Boubin said. “The camera we are using is processing 250 MB of data per second, which is a lot — that would take up all of the internet capabilities of an entire house, easily.”

“MIX” refers to how Boubin’s device can process large amounts of data while detecting true pixels of light from an object and not letting reflections from surrounding objects be mistaken for real things.

“This level of detection is game-changing for spotting anomalies like crop disease or picking up contamination in bodies of water before it’s even visible,” he said.

As Boubin heads into the fall semester, he will balance the demands of faculty and business-owner life: “It’s an ongoing learning experience being in these programs, and having the help and guidance of the Office of Entrepreneurship staff has been most impactful for accelerating this technology,” he said. “I’ve learned so much.”

What’s next for REMIX? More customer discovery: The NSF’s I-Corps model aims for businesses to talk with at least 100 potential customers to understand their needs and develop a path to translate their product or service from lab to market. Boubin and his team are continuing their customer discovery work at a satellite conference in Utah this August.

Computer science student Jacqueline Liu, PhD ’27, is returning to Boubin’s lab this fall after a summer internship with the Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL), where she continued her research that applies to the REMIX solutions with aerospace and defense applications. Liu is a Science, Mathematics and Research for Transformation (SMART) Student, which is a U.S. Department of Defense scholarship program for STEM students. The internship at AFRL was an opportunity that’s part of the SMART program.

“In my role as graduate student intern, I had a lot of flexibility to do any research project that will eventually contribute to my dissertation, so I did research on band selection for hyperspectral imagery (HSI),” Liu said. “My favorite moment from this internship is experiencing the flight test with a miniaturized HSI camera mounted on the drone. Dr. Boubin and my labmates are very talented, and I learned a lot from them.”

The next step after customer discovery is going through a business accelerator program or applying to the Seed Translation Research Project (STRP), which awards up to $150,000 as a grant to support innovation commercialization through EIP’s EXCEED program.

Boubin offered this advice to fellow faculty doing research: “The [EIP] office is always sending out opportunities for funding business development to faculty. I really think more faculty ought to take a look around their labs and see what tech or research they’re working on could have a real-world impact.”","Sentiment score 0.30000001192092896 , Sentiment Magnitude 14.699999809265137","name:Jayson Boubin type: 1 Salience 0.07693502306938171, name:Boubin type: 2 Salience 0.04380911961197853, name:Demo Day type: 3 Salience 0.04231724888086319, name:Jacqueline Liu type: 1 Salience 0.041659388691186905, name:S4 type: 6 Salience 0.036877382546663284, name:researchers type: 1 Salience 0.02699417807161808, name:student type: 1 Salience 0.023690614849328995, name:teams type: 3 Salience 0.019577961415052414, name:SUNY Empire Innovation Professor type: 1 Salience 0.016735941171646118, name:faculty members type: 1 Salience 0.016175750643014908, name:researcher type: 1 Salience 0.01209980621933937, name:faculty type: 1 Salience 0.01094777137041092, name:students type: 1 Salience 0.010103759355843067, name:cameras type: 6 Salience 0.00852245930582285, name:room type: 2 Salience 0.00842705462127924, name:SUNY type: 3 Salience 0.007906622253358364, name:staff type: 1 Salience 0.007708175573498011, name:EIP type: 3 Salience 0.007091873791068792, name:winner type: 1 Salience 0.006795413792133331, name:home type: 2 Salience 0.006795413792133331","Category:/Business & Industrial , Category_confidence:58.0%"
https://www.ncaa.com/news/football/article/2025-07-31/top-30-fbs-college-football-nonconference-games-season,"The 2025 college football season will be here in no time, so it's only right to highlight some of the best nonconference games in the FBS that you can't miss. These matchups could make or break your favorite team's season, either with College Football Playoff seeding or bragging rights.

Here are the top nonconference games for the 2025 season.

Week 1

Texas at Ohio State

Alabama at Florida State

LSU at Clemson

Nebraska vs. Cincinnati in Kansas City, Mo.

Syracuse vs. Tennessee in Atlanta

Virginia Tech vs. South Carolina in Atlanta

Georgia Tech at Colorado

Utah at UCLA

Notre Dame at Miami (Fla.)

TCU at North Carolina

Week 1 is full of nonconference games, and I have 10 here that you need to watch. The biggest game of them all is Texas at Ohio State. It’s a rematch of the College Football Playoff semifinals and it’ll most likely be a top-five matchup — if not top-two or three.

Alabama at Florida State has drawn plenty of hype thanks to new quarterback Tommy Castellanos’ trash talking this offseason. The trash talk has also reached Week 1 opponents LSU and Clemson as they battle over who’s the real “Death Valley” in an expected top-10 contest.

The Saturday slate will also see Coach Prime and Colorado without Shedeur Sanders and Travis Hunter for the first time. They’ll battle a Georgia Tech team led by a darkhorse preseason Heisman contender in Haynes King.

There’s a trio of neutral site contests to watch in Week 1 as Nebraska and Cincinnati play in the home of the Kansas City Chiefs. Syracuse and Tennessee (Saturday) and then Virginia Tech and South Carolina (Sunday) play in the home of the Atlanta Falcons.

Week 1 extends beyond Saturday as Notre Dame plays Miami on Sunday for the first time since 2017. This will likely be a ranked matchup as the CFP is the expectation in both South Bend and Coral Gables this fall. Monday closes the weekend as six-time Super Bowl winning head coach Bill Belichick makes his debut for North Carolina hosting TCU.

RANKINGS: See the latest college football rankings

Week 2

Michigan at Oklahoma

Arizona State at Mississippi State

Iowa at Iowa State

Baylor at SMU

A Big Ten-SEC matchup is always one to watch, especially when it's a pair of bluebloods with new quarterbacks like Michigan and Oklahoma. Elsewhere in the SEC, Mississippi State hosts Arizona State. If the Sun Devils can pick up a road SEC win, it’ll show they haven’t lost a step from their CFP run a year ago.

The last two nonconference games on this list are in-state battles as Iowa and Iowa State battle for the Cy-Hawk trophy and Baylor and SMU meet for the first time since 2016.

Week 3

Texas A&M at Notre Dame

Wisconsin at Alabama

Pitt at West Virginia

Florida Atlantic at FIU

Duke at Tulane

Week 3 features some big brands facing off like Texas A&M-Notre Dame and Wisconsin-Alabama, plus the Backyard Brawl. However, two games featuring American Conference schools catch my eye, too.

Florida Atlantic and FIU are a quick (pending traffic) trip up I-95 apart from one another in south Florida. The two programs are in different conferences, but share the same weather and recruiting base. The intensity between these in-state programs should be high.

I’ll call this last game the Darian Mensah Bowl. That’s the name of Duke’s new quarterback that transferred from Tulane this offseason. Can Mensah beat his old program, or will Tulane show Mensah what he missed out on?

PORTAL: College football transfers at every position that can have an instant impact in 2025

Week 4

Washington at Washington State

Oregon State at Oregon

SMU at TCU

Florida at Miami (FL)

James Madison at Liberty

The Apple Cup and Civil War are two rivalries that we almost missed out on because of conference realignment, but we get to see the schools play again in 2025. Another pair of in-state contests should also be intriguing as SMU plays TCU and Florida plays Miami.

James Madison at Liberty closes the Week 4 slate as the Dukes out of the Sun Belt and the Flames out of Conference USA could each win their conferences in 2025. That means this nonconference game could be the deciding factor as to which team receives the CFP automatic bid.

Week 6

Boise State at Notre Dame

Notre Dame makes another appearance here thanks to its independent status making every game a nonconference game. Boise State comes to town in Week 6 to play the Fighting Irish, and it’ll be a matchup of two playoff teams from last year. Speaking of last year, Boise State pushed Oregon in a three-point defeat. The Broncos won’t be an easy win for Notre Dame.

Week 8

Southern California at Notre Dame

The USC-Notre Dame football rivalry is one of the most storied nonconference rivalries in sports. USC will enter the contest after what figures to be a tough home battle against Michigan, while Notre Dame enters after a home game against NC State. A loss from either team will dampen playoff hopes, so a lot is at stake here.

Week 14

Georgia at Georgia Tech

Clemson at South Carolina

Florida State at Florida

Kentucky at Louisville

Week 14 means rivalry week is here. Four matchups already catch my eye in the preseason. We saw an eight-overtime classic in 2024 between Georgia and Georgia Tech, and by the time these two programs meet in 2025, they both could have clinched conference title game berths.

The same goes for Clemson and South Carolina. Both teams were on the CFP bubble entering the game last year — and this year the Tigers and Gamecocks have their eyes on a playoff run yet again.

The final two games are ACC-SEC battles. Florida and Louisville are the two teams to watch here as both have displayed the talent to make a run at their respective conference titles. However, it’s rivalry week so anything can happen with emotions high.","Sentiment score 0.10000000149011612 , Sentiment Magnitude 16.700000762939453","name:Notre Dame type: 2 Salience 0.05721224844455719, name:rematch type: 4 Salience 0.04722665622830391, name:LSU type: 3 Salience 0.04332418367266655, name:matchup type: 4 Salience 0.03341672196984291, name:nonconference games type: 4 Salience 0.0293638426810503, name:Boise State type: 3 Salience 0.028085630387067795, name:TCU type: 3 Salience 0.02473066933453083, name:college football season type: 4 Salience 0.02326175570487976, name:Mississippi State type: 3 Salience 0.019185082986950874, name:Georgia Tech type: 3 Salience 0.017122581601142883, name:game type: 4 Salience 0.016560623422265053, name:South Carolina type: 2 Salience 0.016321983188390732, name:Clemson type: 2 Salience 0.015466006472706795, name:Ohio State type: 3 Salience 0.01197759062051773, name:Alabama type: 2 Salience 0.01197464857250452, name:team type: 3 Salience 0.011327894404530525, name:matchups type: 4 Salience 0.010855020023882389, name:Florida State type: 3 Salience 0.009567372500896454, name:Texas type: 2 Salience 0.009540374390780926, name:Darian Mensah Bowl type: 1 Salience 0.009339101612567902","Category:/Sports/College Sports , Category_confidence:97.0%"

https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2025/08/physicians-embrace-ai-note-taking-technology/,"AI-driven scribes that record patient visits and draft clinical notes for physician review led to significant reductions in physician burnout and improvements in well-being, according to a Mass General Brigham study of two large healthcare systems.

The findings, published in JAMA Network Open, draw on surveys of more than 1,400 physicians and advanced practice providers at both Harvard-affiliated Mass General Brigham and Atlanta’s Emory Healthcare.

At MGB, use of ambient documentation technologies was associated with a 21.2 percent absolute reduction in burnout prevalence at 84 days, while Emory Healthcare saw a 30.7 percent absolute increase in documentation-related well-being at 60 days.

50% Physician burnout linked to maintaining electronic patient files

“Ambient documentation technology has been truly transformative in freeing up physicians from their keyboards to have more face-to-face interaction with their patients,” said study co-senior author Rebecca Mishuris, chief medical information officer at MGB, a faculty member at Harvard Medical School, and a primary care physician in the healthcare system. “Our physicians tell us that they have their nights and weekends back and have rediscovered their joy of practicing medicine. There is literally no other intervention in our field that impacts burnout to this extent.”

Physician burnout affects more than 50 percent of U.S. doctors and has been linked to time spent in electronic health records, particularly after hours. There is additional evidence that the burden and anticipation of needing to complete their appointment notes also contributes significantly to physician burnout.

“Burnout adversely impacts both providers and their patients who face greater risks to their safety and access to care,” said Lisa Rotenstein, a co-senior study author and director of The Center for Physician Experience and Practice Excellence at Brigham and Women’s Hospital. She is also an assistant clinical professor of medicine at the UCSF School of Medicine. “This is an issue that hospitals nationwide are looking to tackle, and ambient documentation provides a scalable technology worth further study.”

“Our physicians tell us that they have their nights and weekends back and have rediscovered their joy of practicing medicine.” Rebecca Mishuris, Mass General Brigham



Qualitative feedback from users touted that ambient documentation enabled more “contact with patients and families,” improvements in their “joy in practice,” while recognizing its potential to “fundamentally [change] the experience of being a physician.” However, some users felt it added time to their note-writing or had less utility for certain visit types or medical specialties. Since the pilot studies began, the AI technologies have evolved as the vendors make changes based on user feedback and the large language models that power the technologies improve themselves through additional training, warranting continued study.

The researchers analyzed survey data from pilot users of ambient documentation technologies at two large health systems. At Mass General Brigham, 873 physicians and advanced practice providers were given surveys before enrolling, then after 42 and 84 days. About 30 percent of users responded to the surveys at 42 days, and 22 percent at 84 days. All 557 Emory pilot users were surveyed before the pilots and then at 60 days of use, with an 11 percent response rate. Researchers analyzed the survey results quantifying different measures of burnout at Mass General Brigham and physician well-being at Emory Healthcare.

The study authors added that given that these were pilot users and there were limited survey response rates, the findings likely represent the experience of more enthusiastic users, and more research is needed to track clinical use of ambient documentation across a broader group of providers.

Mass General Brigham’s ambient documentation program launched in July 2023 as a proof-of-concept pilot study involving 18 physicians. By July 2024, the pilot, which tested two different ambient documentation technologies, expanded to more than 800 providers. As of April 2025, the technologies have been made available to all Mass General Brigham physicians, with more than 3,000 providers routinely using the tools. Later this year, the program will look to expand to other healthcare professionals such as nurses, physical and occupational therapists, and speech-language pathologists.

“Ambient documentation technology offers a step forward in healthcare and new tools that may positively impact our clinical teams,” said Jacqueline You, lead study author and a digital clinical lead and primary care associate physician at Mass General Brigham. “While stories of providers being able to call more patients or go home and play with their kids without having to worry about notes are powerful, we feel the burnout data speak similar volumes of the promise of these technologies, and importance of continuing to study them.”

Ambient documentation’s use will continue to be studied with surveys and other measures tracking burnout rates and time spent on clinical notes inside and outside of working hours. Researchers will evaluate whether burnout rates improve over time as the AI evolves, or if these burnout gains plateau or are reversed.

https://www.psu.edu/news/agricultural-sciences/story/penn-states-2025-ag-progress-days-success-showcasing-innovation-impact,"UNIVERSITY PARK, Pa. — Penn State’s Ag Progress Days, held Aug. 12-14 at the Russell E. Larson Agricultural Research Center at Rock Springs, was a successful showcase of agricultural innovation, research and technology, according to leaders in the College of Agricultural Sciences, which sponsored the event.

Over its three-day run, the annual expo attracted an estimated 42,000 visitors from throughout Pennsylvania and beyond — including agricultural producers and industry representatives, government officials, consumers and families, home gardeners, environmental advocates, horse enthusiasts, and others.

Attendees perused more than 430 commercial and educational exhibits, took tours of the research center, watched farm safety and field machinery demonstrations, took in presentations and workshops, learned about foods and healthy living, participated in hands-on activities for youth, and enjoyed other activities.

By highlighting research involving emerging and advanced technologies — and the educational programs that translate the science for producers, students, communities and consumers — the college was able to demonstrate the return Pennsylvania receives on its investment in agricultural research and extension, noted Troy Ott, dean of the College of Agricultural Sciences.

“As Pennsylvania’s only land-grant university, we serve agriculture by developing science-based solutions, technological innovations, and a highly trained workforce to address the challenges and capture the opportunities that will drive economic prosperity in the commonwealth,” Ott said. “At Ag Progress Days, we were able to give producers, policymakers and the public a glimpse of how their land-grant university is using the resources entrusted to us to advance and deploy these technologies and find solutions to the challenges we face.”","Sentiment score 0.30000001192092896 , Sentiment Magnitude 2.5999999046325684","name:producers type: 1 Salience 0.09878567606210709, name:College of Agricultural Sciences type: 3 Salience 0.08160008490085602, name:Pa type: 2 Salience 0.03478529676795006, name:UNIVERSITY PARK type: 2 Salience 0.03478529676795006, name:showcase type: 4 Salience 0.030808545649051666, name:expo type: 4 Salience 0.027196884155273438, name:Russell E.

https://news.microsoft.com/source/features/digital-transformation/the-nfl-and-microsoft-expand-their-partnership-and-introduce-sideline-technology-using-ai-innovation/,"In the lightning-quick world of the National Football League (NFL), there’s very little time to noodle on decisions. Speed is of the essence and every second matters. The sideline is hectic, the crowd raucous. Utilizing technology can be a swing factor in a league where the margins are thin between victory and defeat.

“The game’s not stopping. You have 40 seconds between each play or 25 seconds out of a clock stoppage. These decisions happen quickly,” says Los Angeles Rams coach Sean McVay.

“There are external factors that distract you from being able to make the best decisions. You look back and say, ‘What was I thinking?’ By being able to have this technology, it will help you be able to make more consistent decisions that are in alignment with what you want to do to ultimately put your players in the best places in a game that has so many moving parts.”

Today, the NFL and Microsoft announced a multi-year strategic partnership extension to help usher in a new era of AI innovation throughout the league. Microsoft Copilot and Azure AI will help enhance the way coaches and players connect insights from the sideline to play on the field. It will also transform the workplace experience for football and business operations staff off the field.

The NFL is one of the world’s most popular sports leagues, with 335 events each season and hundreds of millions of fans across the globe. Incorporating the new Microsoft solutions will help drive innovation and enhance the game day experience leaguewide from the sideline to team headquarters to the league office.

“We are entering a new era of innovation at the NFL through our collaboration with Microsoft to deploy AI across key areas of the business,” says Gary Brantley, CIO of the NFL. “Enhancing the league is a responsibility we take seriously, and Microsoft has been a trusted sideline technology partner for over a decade. With Microsoft’s AI technologies, including Copilot, there are tremendous opportunities to elevate the game day experience for our clubs and deliver an even more compelling product to our fans.”

AI on the sideline

From game day insights to strategic decision-making, utilizing tools like the Sideline Viewing System (SVS) powered by Copilot will enable coaches and players to access and analyze data in real-time to help make more informed decisions in a more efficient and customized way.

For example, in what formation was the defense when it forced a turnover? An offensive unit can use the SVS and Copilot to filter game-changing moments like that to help gain some insight on why a play turned out the way it did.

McVay has been one of the coaches at the forefront of using technology to assist with his game day preparation and in-game adjustments. The Super Bowl-winning coach of the Rams says being able to give his players the information they need in the heat of battle is key.

“This is a space that we’ve really leaned heavily into,” McVay says. “It’s coming and it’s going to be a valuable tool. You can’t run away from it. This is an opportunity for us to say – in a league that has such small margins of victory week in and week out because of the level of competition – what are some of the ways that we can create edges or win in the margins?”

This season, the SVS has been upgraded with 2,500-plus Surface Copilot+ PCs to equip 32 teams, roughly 1,800 players and more than 1,000 coaches and team football staff with real-time game data and insights.

Coaches and players can access a new SVS feature built with GitHub Copilot to filter real-time key moments like penalties, fumbles and scoring plays, and collaborate between the sidelines and the coaches’ booth to analyze plays through their devices.

While some players and position groups may be more comfortable with using sideline devices during the game, some of the hidden benefits of using AI solutions can occur during the week leading up to the contest, when players are being asked to absorb a large amount of information about themselves and their opponents.

“If we can really be able to say that the amount of information we want to give to a player can be provided in a digestible manner in 30 minutes as opposed to an hour, well now, that’s 30 minutes he can spend maybe resting and recovering,” McVay says. “That’s something we’re always hunting up, because time is one of our most valuable resources. If we’re able to get a lot more done in less time, I think that allows us to be at our best.”

With so many devices featuring so much critical information, functionality and security are essential. Microsoft worked closely with the NFL to ensure that the SVS works smoothly if it’s a snowy day in Green Bay or when the league goes abroad to Dublin, Ireland for the first time in September.

Security is also paramount. The SVS system is connected to NFL-managed Windows servers that enable teams to use the devices without any concern of outside interference.

“What does it mean to roll out technology in our environment?” says Aaron Amendolia, the NFL’s deputy chief information officer. “The elements are super important. We play in all different types of stadiums. There’re covered domes. There’s weather exposure. The device has to work in all these conditions. The battery has to be reliable. And it also has to have connectivity across all regions of the world.

“You’ve got 2,500 devices in play here. There’s a partnership (with Microsoft) to make sure these devices have all the right patches for security, that the device itself is robust, that we’ve built security into the designs of our applications, and that the AI has governance and security and trust around it. Because this is our most sensitive data around the game.”

Beyond the sideline

While AI on the sidelines allows teams to make decisions with speed and confidence, there are other scenarios where technology helps teams push for an edge on the road to game day. In addition to upgrading the SVS, this year the NFL is deploying an upgraded dashboard created with Excel and paired with Microsoft 365 Copilot to assist team data analysts – one of the fastest-growing staff positions in the NFL as more teams utilize this unique role to help pull data insights to bolster game strategies.

The new dashboard can help with formula building, data visualization and improved data types. The dashboard is found on a Surface Laptop 7 that is connected to each team’s analyst and can’t be used outside of game day. The analyst gains control of the spreadsheet 30 minutes before kickoff in the coaches’ booth.

For the Rams, McVay notes that having the analysts use Copilot will speed up the process of gathering information, which can be critical in recognizing offensive and defensive formations, seeing how teams dial up defenses based on down and distance, and making halftime adjustments.

Analysts can use Copilot to generate formulas, apply formatting and visualize trends. As shown, Copilot applies conditional formatting to highlight players that had played more than 50 offensive snaps and 50 or more rushing yards.

“We have people up in the booth who are responsible for charting a lot of the things that Copilot can sequence and segment in a much more accelerated manner, and so that’s going to allow us to be able to make better in-game decisions,” he says. “And it’s going to increase the overall efficiency of what we’re trying to get to our players in real-time. It’s going to be a big deal for us.”

The latest developments in the partnership between the NFL and Microsoft are the next steps in a 10-plus year relationship between the organizations that began with the shared vision of harnessing technology to unlock new levels of performance and insights. The results are a long way from the old days of teams sending pictures of formations from the coaches’ box to the sideline via a wire.

“We used to do a lot of this work with paper on the sidelines,” Amendolia says. “We had printers and a big infrastructure to support that. And then we digitized and moved to the Surface device and that was sort of the first step. And now AI and Copilot are going to be very impactful.”

The future of football

That impact goes beyond the sideline into overall game operations and as teams search for the next generation of stars. The NFL is using Microsoft AI for several off-the-field use cases for football and business operations staff.

During the 2025 NFL Combine, scouts and coaches used an enhanced app built with Microsoft Azure AI Foundry to provide more intelligent and real-time insights from more than 300 prospects. Individual clubs like the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, New York Jets and Minnesota Vikings used Copilot to help with marketing, promotion efforts and fan engagement.

The NFL and Microsoft also are looking into other ways Copilot can boost the game day experience, including an operations dashboard to track and plan for elements that could impact game day operations, and Copilot-powered game summaries for both NFL teams and fans to gain a deeper understanding of what’s happening on the field.

As the 2025 season kicks off, fans should get used to the sight of coaches and players throughout the NFL scouring their SVS systems to help them achieve optimal outcomes, as more teams and players get comfortable with the benefits the technology provides.

“When I look at when I started coaching back in 2008 to where it is now, it’s amazing to me,” McVay says. “The amount of information that’s at your fingertips is so valuable. When you look at the accelerated pace at which this is coming into our game and what a prominent part of our game it’s become, it’s important to embrace it. Because you’ll be behind if you don’t.”

https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/news/no-youre-overrated-a-study-of-college-footballs-10-most-overhyped-teams-over-the-last-decade/,"The future of Texas A&M football looked brighter than ever in December of 2012 as Johnny Manziel cradled the Heisman Trophy in Manhattan before the Aggies capped an 11-2 season with a Cotton Bowl victory over Oklahoma. A&M was fresh off a wildly successful debut campaign for coach Kevin Sumlin and had sent a warning shot to the SEC during its first year in the league by winning at No. 1 Alabama.

Backed by big boosters, with a massive stadium renovation project on deck and a home in college football's top conference, the Aggies looked poise to claim a spot in college football's ruling class. In retrospect, however, that 2012 season is the 21st century high-water mark for a program that is always at least somewhat relevant but never dominant.

A&M's efforts to spend its way to the top have failed, leading to a program reset under Mike Elko for the 2024 season that Aggies fans hope will begin paying dividends in 2025. The Aggies have languished behind their expectations, but they aren't alone on college football's misery meter.

Not far behind is a Nebraska program that fancied itself above winning 9 or 10 games on a regular basis under Bo Peeling from 2008-14. In the decade after his firing, the Cornhuskers won nine games just once and only last season snapped a streak of seven consecutive seasons without a bowl appearance.

Though the definition of ""overrated"" is inexact, we've set out to quantify which college football programs have underperformed the most over the past decade. Through coaching salaries, recruiting rankings, program investment, historical success and fan followings, it's easy to identify the programs most serious about winning.

But the payoff -- or lack thereof -- is always found in quantifiable results on the field, especially when there's a large sample size. The 10 most overrated teams of the past decade made a combined one College Football Playoff appearance from 2015-23, when the field was capped at four teams. They've struggled mightily against ranked opposition, and all made at least once coaching change over the decade.

Without further ado, here are college football's 10 most overrated teams of the past decade, encompassing on-field results from 2015-24. Average recruiting ranking is from the 247Sports team rankings while average coach salaries came from USA TODAY's coaches salary database and other reported figures.

Overrated programs of the past decade

1. Texas A&M

10-year record: 77-48

Average coach salary: $7.02 million

Average recruiting ranking: 11.2

Losing seasons: 1

Record vs. top 25: 17-26

CFP appearances: 0

Texas A&M spent as big as anyone to try and bring about a successful decade, only to be met with mediocrity at every turn. The beginning of this 10-year window coincided with the completion of a $484 million Kyle Field renovation project. Then came the arrival of Florida State's Jimbo Fisher, who began his coaching tenure in 2018 as the nation's fourth-highest paid coach. Fisher was rated as an ""A"" hire by CBS Sports and landed four consecutive top-10 recruiting classes, including the No. 1 overall haul in 2022. But it never translated to the field, as the Aggies failed to reach 10 wins at any point in his six-year tenure. Replacement Mike Elko got off to a 7-1 start last season before finishing 8-5. A&M's only top-10 finish since Johnny Manziel's magical run in 2012 came during the COVID-impacted 2020 season, when the Aggies went 9-1 against a schedule that featured just one ranked regular season foe.

2. Nebraska



10-year record: 50-69

Average coach salary: $4.42 million

Average recruiting ranking: 24.3

Losing seasons: 8

Record vs. top 25: 2-28

CFP appearances: 0

The hiring of Scott Frost at the end of the 2017 season drew an ""A"" grade from CBS Sports. The native son was coming off an undefeated season at UCF and looked like a slam dunk. But he limped to a 16-31 (10-26 Big Ten) record over five seasons, even while regularly signing top-25 classes. The Cornhuskers never beat a ranked team under Frost's leadership -- despite making plenty of appearances on FOX's Big Noon Kickoff -- while suffering an endless cascade of close losses. The jury is still out on whether successor Matt Rhule is going to make Nebraska a real player in the Big Ten. He also received an ""A"" grade but is just 12-13 through two seasons. There's never been a season when true greatness was expected from the Cornhuskers in the past 10 years. But they've failed to even reach competence.

3. Auburn



10-year record: 70-57

Average coach salary: $5.73 million

Average recruiting ranking: 12.3

Losing seasons: 4

Record vs. top 25: 15-38

CFP appearances: 0

Auburn's decade of gloom encompasses the final six years of Gus Malzahn's tenure, the disastrous two-year reign of Bryan Harsin and a similarly uninspiring beginning to Hugh Freeze's run. The program's 15-38 mark vs. ranked foes is largely explained by a 2-8 record vs. arch rival Alabama and a 1-10 mark vs. historic rival Georgia (they met twice in 2017). Despite never finishing with a recruiting class outside the top-20 during the span, Auburn has finished in the top 10 of the CFP rankings just once in the past decade. Harsin's hire was graded a B+, and landing Freeze earned the Tigers an ""A."" But the Tigers have nonetheless continued falling short of the pace set by the Bulldogs and Crimson Tide and of their own standards.

4. Florida State

10-year record: 71-53

Average coach salary: $5.52 million

Average recruiting ranking: 13.6

Losing seasons: 5

Record vs. top 25: 10-25

CFP appearances: 0

Between the final three seasons of Jimbo Fisher's tenure and the seven years since, Florida State certainly hasn't been boring. But outside of 2023, it's almost always been disappointing. Even that season was tainted by an injury to quarterback Jordan Travis that was used (unfairly) as justification for leaving the undefeated ACC champions out of the CFP. Five of FSU's past seven campaigns have been of the losing variety, including last year's dismal 2-10 mark. The Seminoles may view themselves as too good for the ACC, but that view is misaligned with their recent performance.

5. Florida

10-year record: 77-50

Average coach salary: $6.04 million

Average recruiting ranking: 13.4

Losing seasons: 4

Record vs. top 25: 13-31

CFP appearances: 0

A strong finish to a brutally challenging 2024 slate and the emergence of rising sophomore quarterback DJ Lagway provide hope that Florida is turning the page. But the program's past 10 years featured the unfruitful tenure of Jim McElwain, the rise and fall of Dan Mullen and the unpleasantries of a slow start for Billy Napier. Florida's three straight losing seasons from 2021-23 marked the first such run for the program since 1947-49. The past decade-plus has been humbling for a UF program that won seven SEC titles under Steve Spurrier and Urban Meyer from 1993-08.

6. USC

10-year record: 77-47

Average coach salary: N/A*

Average recruiting ranking: 13.2

Losing seasons: 2

Record vs. top 25: 15-28

CFP appearances: 0

USC started 11-1 in 2022 before getting stuffed in a locker by Utah in the Pac-12 Championship Game and missing out on the CFP. The Trojans are just 15-12 since that loss, and Lincoln Riley needs a big 2025 to reclaim the excitement which accompanied his arrival from Oklahoma. Prior to Riley, Clay Helton posted a 46-24 record -- which doesn't seem so bad in retrospect -- but never made the CFP while competing in a mediocre Pac-12. Realignment might be good for USC's pocketbook, but it's becoming increasingly apparent that living up to the program's historical standards will be a challenge in the Big Ten.

7. North Carolina

10-year record: 68-60

Average coach salary: $3.42 million

Average recruiting ranking: 24.1

Losing seasons: 4

Record vs. top 25: 8-18

CFP appearances: 0

The Tar Heels started the 2015-24 span with their high-water mark of 11-3 under Larry Fedora. After Fedora went 5-18 in his final two seasons, UNC turned to Mack Brown. He produced three straight top-15 recruiting classes from 2020-22 and some elite quarterback play with Sam Howell and Drake Maye. But Carolina never reached 10 wins under Brown, and his teams always seemed to lose steam late. North Carolina has risen into the top 15 of the AP poll at some point in five of the past nine seasons but has finished ranked just once. Given the recruiting success, quarterback talent and quality of competition, it's hard to blame North Carolina for wanting more. Is Bill Belichick the coach who can provide it?

8. Miami

Average recruiting ranking: 15.0

Losing seasons: 2

Record vs. top 25: 10-17

CFP appearances: 0

The program is trending up as Mario Cristobal enters Year 4 on the job on the heels of a 10-3 season led by departed star quarterback Cam Ward. But the past decade encompasses the ending of Al Golden's tenure and the awkward three-year stints of Mark Richt and Manny Diaz. Cristobal also got off to a clumsy 12-13 start, which included the 2023 no-kneel debacle in a loss to Georgia Tech. Is the ""U"" finally back after all that? If so, it has certainly paid its dues over a decade that featured few highs, aside from a flash-in-the-pan 10-0 start in 2017 that fizzled with three straight losses.

9. Texas

10-year record: 80-49

Average coach salary: $6.09 million

Average recruiting ranking: 8.4

Losing seasons: 3

Record vs. top 25: 25-27

CFP appearances: 2 (2023, 2024)

Take it easy, Longhorns fans: Texas is finally on the other side of it now with a 25-5 mark over the past two seasons leading into the dawn of Arch Manning's starting tenure. But the 2015-24 run began with consecutive losing seasons under Charlie Strong before a lukewarm four-year tenure for Tom Herman. Texas also went just 4-7 against Oklahoma over the past decade. Steve Sarkisian now ranks as the No. 4 coach in the sport, but he was just 13-12 through two seasons before correcting the program's course with consecutive CFP semifinal appearances.

10. Tennessee

10-year record: 75-50

Average coach salary: $5.04 million

Average recruiting ranking: 14.2

Losing seasons: 3

Record vs. top 25: 18-29

CFP appearances: 1 (2024)

Tennessee is on firm footing now under Josh Heupel, who is 37-15, coming off a CFP appearance and in possession of two wins over Alabama. But the Volunteers epitomized an underperforming program during the tail end of Butch Jones' tenure and during Jeremy Pruitt's three-year run. The Vols stacked consecutive top-10 classes in 2014 and 2015 and reached No. 9 during a 5-0 start to the 2016 season. But Jones finished just 8-10 from there before a disastrous coaching search that led to Pruitt. The ex-Alabama defensive coordinator posted a 16-19 record and fizzled out in a cloud of alleged NCAA violations. Heupel has done well to pull the program from that mess and salvage the decade.","Sentiment score 0.0 , Sentiment Magnitude 42.5","name:Texas A&M type: 3 Salience 0.08008015155792236, name:appearances type: 4 Salience 0.052740391343832016, name:CFP type: 3 Salience 0.029163269326090813, name:Jimbo Fisher type: 1 Salience 0.0173964761197567, name:season type: 4 Salience 0.013875456526875496, name:Oklahoma type: 2 Salience 0.006847857963293791, name:Kevin Sumlin type: 1 Salience 0.0060580698773264885, name:victory type: 4 Salience 0.005621355026960373, name:Cotton Bowl type: 4 Salience 0.0037842560559511185, name:Manhattan type: 2 Salience 0.003324118908494711, name:games type: 4 Salience 0.003311028704047203, name:Matt Rhule type: 1 Salience 0.0032404661178588867, name:coach type: 1 Salience 0.0031780197750777006, name:Johnny Manziel type: 1 Salience 0.0031426199711859226, name:fans type: 1 Salience 0.003037514165043831, name:wins type: 4 Salience 0.0026893692556768656, name:conference type: 4 Salience 0.002684883074834943, name:boosters type: 1 Salience 0.002684883074834943, name:home type: 2 Salience 0.002684883074834943, name:firing type: 4 Salience 0.0026526793371886015","Category:/Sports/Team Sports/American Football , Category_confidence:97.0%"

NIH Publishes Plan to Drive Gold Standard Science

Image

I am pleased to announce the release of NIH’s new plan to promote gold standard science across all agency activities. Building on NIH’s longstanding commitment to scientific integrity, this forward-looking plan incorporates the nine, interlocking tenets of gold standard science adopted by the U.S. Government and aligns with the Department of Health and Human Services’ framework for achieving these principles.

NIH policies and programs often span multiple tenets. As such, the new plan is intentionally interwoven—highlighting our progress while laying out a bold vision for the future.

Gold standard science isn’t just what we strive for, it is embedded in everything we do, from the research we support to the policies and programs we create. By ensuring our scientific findings are objective, credible, and accessible to the public, NIH is well positioned to continue to lead the U.S. in transforming discovery into improved health.

https://techcrunch.com/2025/08/21/nvidia-is-latest-investor-to-back-av-startup-nuro-in-203m-funding-round/,"Nvidia is among a group of new investors to back Nuro — which develops self-driving software for delivery and ride-hailing services — in a funding round that has reached $203 million.

The Silicon Valley startup announced Thursday that several investors, including existing backer Baillie Gifford, added another $97 million to its Series E round. New investors include Icehouse Ventures, Kindred Ventures, Nvidia, and Pledge Ventures. Uber, which last month said it would make a “multi-hundred-million dollar” investment in Nuro as part of a broader deal with the electric car maker Lucid, also participated.

Nvidia’s investment follows years of technical collaboration with Nuro. The startup uses Nvidia GPUs for its large-scale data processing and model training, and its latest compute model is built on the Nvidia Drive AGX Thor platform.

The first $106 million tranche of Series E funding was announced in April. Investment accounts advised by T. Rowe Price Associates, Fidelity Management & Research Company, Tiger Global Management, Greylock Partners, and XN participated in that first block.

Nuro has raised $2.3 billion to date. Its Series E post-money valuation is $6 billion. That’s a 30% drop from its $8.6 billion valuation in 2021 when Nuro raised $600 million in a Series D round.

Much has changed in the past four years for Nuro and the broader autonomous vehicle industry. Like most startups in the nascent autonomous vehicle technology sector, Nuro was forced to examine its business model after economic conditions shut off the once-free-flowing tap of capital and ushered in a period of consolidation.

Nuro went through several rounds of layoffs in 2022 and 2023 before overhauling its business strategy. In 2024, Nuro scrapped plans to own and operate a fleet of low-speed, on-road delivery bots, and instead focused its efforts on licensing its technology to automakers and mobility providers, like ride-hail and delivery companies.

The pivot has appeared to gain some traction — notably in July when Uber announced plans to launch a robotaxi service using all-electric Lucid Gravity SUVs equipped with Nuro’s self-driving tech. Under the deal, Uber invested $300 million in Lucid and agreed to buy “at least” 20,000 of the EV maker’s Gravity SUVs over the next six years.

Uber also said it would invest an undisclosed “multi-hundred-million dollar” amount into Nuro. One source familiar with the agreement told TechCrunch the amount is more than Uber’s investment in Lucid.

A portion of Uber’s investment has gone toward the Series E round. The remaining investment will be parceled out to Nuro as the company hits certain milestones.

Nuro co-founder and president Dave Ferguson said in a statement that the company is well-positioned to continue its next phase of growth with the new capital.

https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/08/19/nx-s1-5506292/doctors-ai-artificial-intelligence-dependent-colonoscopy,"Research suggests doctors might quickly become dependent on AI

toggle caption Sorbetto/Getty Images

Artificial intelligence is beginning to help doctors screen patients for several routine diseases. But a new study raises concerns about whether doctors might become too reliant on AI.

The study looking at gastroenterologists in Poland found that they appeared to be about 20% worse at spotting polyps and other abnormalities during colonoscopies on their own, after they'd grown accustomed to using an AI-assisted system.

The findings, published in the journal Lancet Gastroenterology and Hepatology, suggest that even after a short period of using AI, experts may become overly dependent on AI to do certain aspects of their jobs.

""We were quite surprised,"" says Marcin Romańczyk, an M.D.-Ph.D. gastroenterologist at H-T Medical Center in Tychy, Poland, who led the study.

But not everyone is convinced that the paper proves doctors are losing critical skills because of AI.

""I think three months seems like a very short period to lose a skill that you took 26 years to build up,"" says Johan Hulleman, a researcher at Manchester University in England who has studied human reliance on artificial intelligence.

Hulleman believes statistical variations in the patient data might be part of the explanation for why the numbers appear to drop. Factors such as the average age of the patients used in different sections of the study might explain the variation, he says.

AI in medicine

Artificial intelligence is becoming increasingly common for a number of routine medical scans. The next time you get a scan for your eyes, breast cancer, or colon disease, there's a decent chance that AI might be analyzing the images.

""AI is spreading everywhere,"" Romańczyk says. At the same time, many doctors are playing catch-up, because learning how to use the technology wasn't part of their training.

""We've been taught from books and from our teachers,"" he says. ""No one told us how to use AI.""

A few years ago, four clinics in Poland tried out an AI system to detect polyps and other abnormalities during colonoscopies. The AI works in real time, analyzing video from a camera inside the colon.

If it spots something, it will highlight the area for the clinician to see.

""In this particular one there's a green box, showing where the polyp might be,"" he says.

In the box

The clinics were collecting data on whether the AI system worked. It turns out it did, but when Romańczyk and his colleagues reanalyzed the data, they found something else: After the system was introduced, doctors became significantly worse at detecting possible polyps when the AI was switched off.

According to their analysis, after doctors got AI, detection rates of possible polyps fell from 28.4% to 22.4% when their new AI system was switched off. In other words, the doctors seemed to become quickly dependent on AI systems catching the polyps. Romańczyk says he's not quite sure why it's happening, but he has some theories.

""We are subconsciously waiting for the green box to come out to show us the region where the polyp is and we're not paying so much attention,"" he says.

There are other examples that support that idea: A similar study has shown that nonexperts do a worse job scanning mammograms if they know they can get an AI system to help them with the push of a button.

Johan Hulleman, who helped lead that mammogram study, describes it as a ""safety-net effect."" He says these latest results could be interesting, but he's skeptical. The study of colonoscopies took place over three months, and the doctors participating had decades of experience. He thinks statistical variations due to a number of factors, such as age of the patients, might be behind the apparent drop.

Additionally, he says, ""We don't know how many polyps there really were, so we don't know the ground truth."" By that he means it's unclear how many of the possible polyps that doctors supposedly missed were actually medically important.

The study's author, Romańczyk, does believe the drop is real — though he admits that studying AI in a clinical setting like this can be tricky. There are a lot of variables the researchers couldn't control.

He's not against using AI. He actually thinks the little green boxes help him to do better colonoscopies. But he thinks that there should be more studies like these examining how AI might be changing the way doctors work in the real world.

""Because look what's happening,"" he says. ""We have AI systems that are available, but we don't have the data.""","Sentiment score -0.20000000298023224 , Sentiment Magnitude 14.399999618530273","name:Johan Hulleman type: 1 Salience 0.08394350111484528, name:Marcin Romańczyk type: 1 Salience 0.07998049259185791, name:doctors type: 1 Salience 0.048124875873327255, name:gastroenterologists type: 1 Salience 0.015722310170531273, name:colonoscopies type: 4 Salience 0.011641676537692547, name:experts type: 1 Salience 0.0078793466091156, name:Sorbetto type: 6 Salience 0.006963569205254316, name:Lancet Gastroenterology type: 5 Salience 0.0068705459125339985, name:patients type: 1 Salience 0.004142841789871454, name:Getty Images type: 3 Salience 0.0020921428222209215, name:Poland type: 2 Salience 0.002000251552090049, name:everyone type: 1 Salience 0.0013909176923334599, name:clinician type: 1 Salience 0.0013111853040754795, name:area type: 2 Salience 0.0011282298946753144, name:clinics type: 2 Salience 0.0009747385629452765, name:nonexperts type: 1 Salience 0.0009615297894924879, name:AI type: 3 Salience 0.0009224397945217788, name:No one type: 1 Salience 0.0008895731880329549, name:images type: 5 Salience 0.0008812514715828001, name:books type: 5 Salience 0.0007818370359018445","Category:/Health/Health Conditions , Category_confidence:62.0%"

https://news.northwestern.edu/stories/2025/08/felicia-tuchman-will-never-stop-fighting-for-science/,"I’m 17 years old. Our AP Psychology final project is to design an experiment, collect data and write up the results. My teacher suggests that our group, fascinated by the concept of false memories, reach out to memory researcher Elizabeth Loftus for advice. I email her, and to my surprise, she responds. When I send her a thank you note with our results, she reads our report and congratulates us. I’m astonished that such an established researcher would take the time to review our work and respond.

So begins my unrelenting dream to become a scientist — and mentor.

But today, shrinking federal budgets leave scientists scrambling to sustain their research and staff. In turn, scientists have less time for public education and mentorship.

I’m 18 years old. I’m starting at Northwestern in the fall and majoring in psychology. A friend’s mom, an addiction counselor, recommends I read “Unbroken Brain” by Maia Szalavitz. The book highlights racial injustice in the “War on Drugs” and how punitive responses to addiction harm lives. This resonates with my experiences growing up, when I witnessed firsthand how punitive systems often caused more harm than healing. I’m driven toward a career in addiction research, where I hope to help kids like me, my friends and our families.

Recent reductions in funding make it harder to conduct research that informs compassionate and equitable treatments. As funding dwindles, people will be less likely to encounter research that reflects their experience and inspires them to join the movement to challenge outdated, harmful approaches to addiction.

Science has brought meaning to my struggles and has saved my life in more ways than one.” Felicia Tuchman ’22

I’m 20 years old, a sophomore at Northwestern. The dorms are closing because of the COVID-19 pandemic. I have no choice but to return home. I hope things will be different, but I know better. Within 10 weeks, my life is in danger. Shelters are closed — I have nowhere to go and five courses to complete. In the nick of time, I receive a Weinberg College summer research grant that provides me the funding I need. I pack up my belongings, rent a car, drive 13 hours back to college (attending calculus class from the highway via Zoom) and settle into the dining room of an acquaintance until I land on my feet.

For the next two years, I practically live in Professor Jennifer Tackett’s Personality Across Development lab — by choice. There, under the mentorship of Tackett and then-graduate student Cassie Brandes, I complete two independent research projects, author an honors thesis, present several research posters and coordinate a multisite collaboration to establish a statewide twin project.

Brandes spends a remarkable amount of time mentoring me, and whenever I thank her, she maintains that she is only paying forward the support she received as an undergraduate. We bond over our shared interests in quantitative methods, and she plays an integral role in my development as a math nerd. She encourages me to take linear algebra, which ends up being my favorite college class. She challenges me with opportunities to learn about advanced statistical models she’s using in her research and inspires me to pick up a data science minor. Brandes is exceptionally patient with me as I navigate a difficult time in my life, and she always looks out for my best interests.

Just as Brandes is my blueprint for the kind of graduate student researcher I want to be, Tackett is my blueprint for the kind of lab director I aspire to be. In addition to giving vital feedback on my independent research and honors thesis projects, Tackett provides a sense of community and home at a time when I’m isolated and facing housing instability. From inviting us all over for the holidays to providing opportunities for undergraduates to take on leadership positions and lead independent research projects, she always makes sure that undergraduate research assistants feel valued and receive quality training.

When it comes time for me to apply to graduate school, the support of Brandes and Tackett are integral to my success. It is because of the Weinberg summer research grant program and my mentors that I’m here today writing this essay. Presently, universities, including mine, face federal funding freezes and terminations that disproportionately harm vulnerable groups. The endowments of universities and salaries of professors are not all that is at stake — the communities these research projects help and the students whose livelihoods depend on funding have the most to lose.

Today, I'm 25 years old. I've published nine peer-reviewed research papers on substance use and substance use disorders, but my future in the field has never been more precarious. Science has taught me integrity, patience and the power of imperfect progress. Science has brought meaning to my struggles and has saved my life in more ways than one. Science is not just something I do. It’s a core part of who I am. If science is taken from me, an important piece of me will be gone.

This is why I’ll never stop fighting for science and why I encourage you to fight alongside me. We have more to lose than funding. Kids today are at risk of missing scientific experiences that shape who they are, create a sense of belonging, make meaning out of pain and show them the magic of creating knowledge that helps others.

https://news.ohsu.edu/2025/08/18/over-the-counter-pill-boosts-access-to-contraception-ohsu-study-finds,"Access to birth control has dramatically improved among women in the U.S. who previously would have used no birth control at all, according to a new study assessing the effects of a decision two years ago by the FDA to allow access to an over-the-counter birth control pill for the first time in the U.S. (OHSU/Christine Torres Hicks)

UPDATE: This story has been updated to reflect the study covered people surveyed in 49 states.

Two years ago, the Food and Drug Administration approved the sale of an over-the-counter birth control pill for the first time in the United States without a prescription.

A nationwide study published today reveals the decision has dramatically improved access to contraception, especially among women who otherwise would have had no birth control at all, either because they lack insurance or routine access to health care. The study was conducted by researchers at Oregon Health & Science University.

See how OHSU continues to lead advancement in reproductive health in this media kit.

Published in the journal JAMA Network Open, the study surveyed 986 people in 49 states who obtained the OTC pill either online or at a pharmacy and compared outcomes with people using the pill by prescription.

The research team found a 31.8 percentage point increase in people who shifted to the pill after using no contraceptive method.

The majority of OTC pill users were not using any method of contraception, or a much less effective method, and reported it was extremely important to them to avoid pregnancy.

Maria Rodriguez, M.D., M.P.H. (OHSU)

“This is one of the first studies to show that over-the-counter birth control pills are reaching the very people they’re meant to help — those who face the greatest barriers to care,” said lead author Maria Rodriguez, M.D., M.P.H., professor of obstetrics and gynecology in the OHSU School of Medicine and director of the OHSU Center for Women’s Health.

Among the group accessing the oral contraceptive pill over the counter, researchers found higher rates of use among racial and ethnic minority groups, adolescents, the uninsured and Medicaid recipients.

“At a time when pregnancy is becoming even more dangerous in the United States — especially for people of color, those with low incomes, and those living in rural communities — our findings underscore that OTC contraception is a powerful tool for reproductive autonomy,” Rodriguez said.

Rodriguez noted that the U.S. Supreme Court’s decision in 2022 to overturn constitutional protection for access to abortion has decreased access to abortion and contraception, especially for populations at the highest risk for maternal injury or death. This study suggests that the OTC birth control pill is helping to address the gap in contraceptive access for the populations with the greatest barriers to care, and notes that it costs about $50 for a three-month supply of the daily oral medication.

“These findings suggest that removing prescription requirements for [the oral contraceptive pill] can expand contraceptive access, particularly for underserved populations, such as the uninsured and those in rural areas,” the authors conclude. “As reproductive health care access faces growing threats, [over-the-counter] contraception offers a promising strategy to support reproductive autonomy and reduce disparities in contraceptive use.”

In addition to Rodriguez, co-authors include Haley Burns, M.P.H., Reed Sheridan, B.S., and Alison Edelman, M.D., M.P.H., all of Oregon Health & Science University.","Sentiment score 0.0 , Sentiment Magnitude 4.699999809265137","name:OHSU type: 3 Salience 0.06896720826625824, name:women type: 1 Salience 0.06559044867753983, name:birth control pill type: 6 Salience 0.03591897711157799, name:Maria Rodriguez type: 1 Salience 0.03157816827297211, name:people type: 1 Salience 0.030373984947800636, name:time type: 4 Salience 0.026084762066602707, name:states type: 2 Salience 0.024689722806215286, name:U.S. type: 2 Salience 0.017467312514781952, name:FDA type: 3 Salience 0.012410647235810757, name:Christine Torres Hicks type: 1 Salience 0.012410647235810757, name:OTC type: 3 Salience 0.012029437348246574, name:story type: 5 Salience 0.010080890730023384, name:over-the-counter birth control pills type: 6 Salience 0.008886582218110561, name:researchers type: 1 Salience 0.008318514563143253, name:pill users type: 1 Salience 0.006534619256854057, name:JAMA Network Open type: 5 Salience 0.005697494838386774, name:majority type: 1 Salience 0.005290200002491474, name:M.D. type: 1 Salience 0.003985332325100899, name:research team type: 3 Salience 0.0036187570076435804, name:group type: 3 Salience 0.002662503160536289","Category:/Health/Reproductive Health , Category_confidence:97.0%"

https://www.nbcnews.com/health/cancer/fat-cells-breast-cancer-tumors-triple-negative-risk-overweight-rcna225598,"Being overweight or obese has long been linked to a greater risk of developing or dying from breast cancer. New research suggests a reason: Certain breast cancer tumors may feed on neighboring fat cells.

The findings may help scientists find ways to treat triple-negative breast cancer, which is notoriously aggressive and has lower survival rates. Moreover, the results may apply to any cancer that uses fat as an energy source, according to the report, published Wednesday in Nature Communications.

Triple-negative accounts for about 15% of all breast cancers. It tends to be more common in Black women and women under 40 and is more likely to recur than other cancers.

The breast tumor cells appear to gain access to the fat cells’ content by poking a straw-like structure into the fat cells and then dislodging the lipids stored there.

If researchers can find a way to block tumors from tunneling into neighboring fat cells without harming patients, they might have a way to cure the often deadly cancers, said the study’s lead author, Jeremy Williams, a postdoctoral scholar at the University of California, San Francisco.

“Aggressive cancer cells can co-opt different nutrient sources to help them grow, including by stimulating fat cells in the breast to release their lipids,” Williams said. “In the future, new treatments might starve the tumor cells by preventing their access to lipids from neighboring cells.” Lipids are fatty compounds, such as cholesterol, that are used largely for energy storage in the body.

Williams and his colleagues ran multiple experiments, some using tissue from breast cancer patients and others using a mouse model of a breast cancer patient.

In the experiments exclusively using human tissue, the researchers examined fat cells at varying distances from tumor cells. They found that the closer the fat cells were to tumor cells, the more depleted in lipids they were.

When the researchers blocked the tumor cells’ ability to build the straw-like structures, officially known as gap junctions, the tumors stopped growing.

They found a similar result in a mouse model, in which tumor cells from breast cancer patients were tweaked genetically so they lost some of their ability to make gap junctions. When the tissue was implanted in mice, the mice were protected.

“Knocking out a single gene impaired the formation and progression of the tumor,” Williams said.

Williams and his colleagues started looking at mechanisms to explain an earlier finding from the lab he worked at.

“These tumors were burning fatty acids as a source of energy,” he said. “It seemed an urgent question to answer where the fatty acids were coming from.”

As it turns out, several medications that inhibit gap junction formation are being studied in early-phase clinical trials for other purposes, Williams said.

How cancer 'grows and feeds itself'

Dr. Julia McGuinness, a breast cancer specialist and an associate professor of medicine at the Columbia University Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, said it’s the first evidence of a mechanism showing the association between fat and cancer.

It’s also “suggesting one pathway to treat aggressive cancers for which we don’t have any good therapies,” McGuinness said. “We already know that obese women who have these kinds of cancer have worse outcomes.”

The new research may also suggest that lifestyle modifications that would help women achieve healthy weights might also protect against such cancers, McGuinness said. “Slimming down could be protective,” she said, adding that obesity has been shown to be a risk factor for all breast cancers.

The authors of the study found ways to look at the mechanism linking fat to breast cancer growth in ways that couldn’t be tested in human beings, said Justin Balko, the Ingram professor of cancer research at Vanderbilt University Medical Center.

“They found a new way cancer grows and feeds itself,” Balko said. “If some of the same effects are observed in humans, it might be fodder for differences in the way we treat patients.”

But there are caveats, Balko said. “For example, we don’t know if this is a major mechanism by which breast cancer grows in humans,” he said. “But it makes a lot of sense.”","Sentiment score -0.10000000149011612 , Sentiment Magnitude 11.100000381469727","name:Jeremy Williams type: 1 Salience 0.3038204312324524, name:breast cancer patients type: 1 Salience 0.013955394737422466, name:researchers type: 1 Salience 0.01312209665775299, name:Julia McGuinness type: 1 Salience 0.011438305489718914, name:colleagues type: 1 Salience 0.010361816734075546, name:report type: 5 Salience 0.006971218157559633, name:scientists type: 1 Salience 0.006037312559783459, name:Nature Communications type: 5 Salience 0.004123501013964415, name:women type: 1 Salience 0.00387193844653666, name:patients type: 1 Salience 0.0037192245945334435, name:content type: 5 Salience 0.002621708670631051, name:breast cancer patient type: 1 Salience 0.0025274818763136864, name:Justin Balko type: 1 Salience 0.0021101636812090874, name:mouse model type: 6 Salience 0.0020176356192678213, name:authors type: 1 Salience 0.001978425309062004, name:others type: 1 Salience 0.0017566645983606577, name:medications type: 6 Salience 0.0017056865617632866, name:lab type: 3 Salience 0.0016224076971411705, name:University of California, San Francisco type: 3 Salience 0.001302368938922882, name:humans type: 1 Salience 0.0009680301882326603","Category:/Health/Health Conditions/Cancer , Category_confidence:93.0%"
https://www.statnews.com/2025/08/21/supreme-court-trump-research-funding-cuts-anti-dei-push/,"WASHINGTON — The Trump administration can slash hundreds of millions of dollars’ worth of research funding in its push to cut federal diversity, equity and inclusion efforts, the Supreme Court decided Thursday.

The high court majority lifted a judge’s order blocking $783 million worth of cuts made by the National Institutes of Health to align with Republican President Donald Trump’s priorities. The high court did keep Trump administration guidance on future funding blocked, however.

The court split 5-4 on the decision. Chief Justice John Roberts was along those who would have kept the cuts blocked, along with the court’s three liberals.

The order marks the latest Supreme Court win for Trump and allows the administration to forge ahead with canceling hundreds of grants while the lawsuit continues to unfold. The plaintiffs, including states and public-health advocacy groups, have argued that the cuts will inflict “incalculable losses in public health and human life.”

The Justice Department, meanwhile, has said funding decisions should not be “subject to judicial second-guessing” and efforts to promote policies referred to as DEI can “conceal insidious racial discrimination.”

The lawsuit addresses only part of the estimated $12 billion of NIH research projects that have been cut, but in its emergency appeal, the Trump administration also took aim at nearly two dozen other times judges have stood in the way of its funding cuts.

Solicitor General D. John Sauer said judges shouldn’t be considering those cases under an earlier Supreme Court decision that cleared the way for teacher-training program cuts. He says they should go to federal claims court instead.

But the plaintiffs, 16 Democratic state attorneys general and public-health advocacy groups, argued that research grants are fundamentally different from the teacher-training contracts and couldn’t be sent to claims court. Halting studies midway can also ruin the data already collected and ultimately harm the country’s potential for scientific breakthroughs by disrupting scientists’ work in the middle of their careers, they argued.

U.S. District Judge William Young judge in Massachusetts agreed, finding the abrupt cancellations were arbitrary and discriminatory. “I’ve never seen government racial discrimination like this,” Young, an appointee of Republican President Ronald Reagan, said at a hearing in June. He later added: “Have we no shame.”

An appeals court left Young’s ruling in place.

For more than half a century, innovation was celebrated as a universal good. That consensus has now cracked. While the imperative to innovate continues to drive change worldwide, critics increasingly depict innovation culture as a source of inequality or accuse its champions of woke groupthink. What changed?

My book “Every American an Innovator,” from which the following article is adapted, tells the story of how experts spread the gospel of innovation — from the cornfields of 1940s Iowa to Silicon Valley tech giants today — transforming the lives of nearly every American in the process. In the following text, adapted from the chapter “Innovators on Trial,” I chronicle the moment the innovation consensus shattered. The entire chapter and an open access edition of the entire book are freely available for download here.

At the dawn of the 21st century, the watchword “innovation” seemed to capture the life-force of the United States. Despite the dot-com bust, the relentless pace of technological change was undeniable.

By the early 2000s, a vast majority of Americans had access to the internet, which in turn facilitated innovations in mobile computing and social media. Just five years after the Apple iPhone hit the market, two-thirds of Americans owned a smartphone while Facebook grew from a few hundred Ivy League students to over a billion users.

This article is adapted from Matthew Wisnioski’s book “Every American an Innovator.” An open access edition of the book is available for free download here.

Like automobility, electricity, and computing in eras past, the smartphone and social networks came with a magical aura — a tactile merger of technology and culture in the palm of your hand, making all the world your friend. Unlike the utopianism of the 1950s, these transformations were not attributed to the inevitable march of technology. Rather, journalists, politicians, academics, and PR specialists linked these breakthroughs to an innovation culture that unified technological, economic, social, and political change.

Exuberance for innovation spanned partisan lines but was especially embraced on the left. The New Yorker, for example, was a leading innovation booster. Its inaugural 2007 “Innovators Issue” profiled scientists at CERN’s Large Hadron Collider, the graffiti artist Banksy, the architects of New York City’s High Line urban park, and billionaire Richard Branson’s foray into biofuels. Staff writer Malcolm Gladwell, meanwhile, became an innovation guru for the masses.

Innovators were the heroes of the new millennium. A cottage industry of memoirs and business histories celebrated billionaire founders, from Nike’s Phil Knight to Amazon’s Jeff Bezos and Tesla’s Elon Musk. The digital entertainment industry championed artistic creativity, lauding the animator–entrepreneurs of Pixar and hip-hop mogul Dr. Dre, who invested in an arts-based innovator academy. The reality show Shark Tank played its part by turning pitch meetings into household entertainment, spotlighting entrepreneurs from all walks of American life.

The New Yorker lovingly canonized Steve Jobs at heaven’s gate with St. Peter searching the Book of Life on an iPad. The New Yorker Magazine, October 17, 2011, “The Book of Life” by Barry Blitt.

Steve Jobs became the national archetype of innovation, proving it wasn’t just for the young or limited to technology and business. After his untimely death from pancreatic cancer, he was enshrined as the greatest innovator of his era. The New Yorker lovingly canonized him at heaven’s gate, with St. Peter searching the Book of Life on an iPad, while Walter Isaacson, former president and CEO of the Aspen Institute, published a biography just two weeks later, declaring Jobs “a magician genius” who “combin[ed] the power of poetry and processors.”

Barack Obama’s presidency was as crucial to this innovation triumphalism as Silicon Valley’s cultural and economic dominance. His 2009 Inaugural Address championed “the risk-takers, the doers, the makers of things” as drivers of American history. Technology journalists reinforced this charismatic image, labeling him the “entrepreneur-in-chief” and “innovator-in-chief.” Indeed, innovation was central to Obama’s governing philosophy: His Strategy for American Innovation fused the technoeconomic blueprint of the 1980s with a focus on access and inclusion, and his cabinet and federal agencies were filled with interdisciplinary experts who moved back and forth between government and the high-tech sector.

The administration cultivated innovators at every life stage and launched programs at virtually every level, from expanding innovation awards to women and minorities to creating fellowships, innovation “boot camps,” and education initiatives designed to nurture innovators from K–12 to government labs.

Innovation expertise had grown into a diverse and widely practiced vocation. Think tanks proffered their own models, such as the Brookings Institution’s blueprints for “Innovation Districts” distributed to municipalities nationwide. Universities, high schools, and even elementary schools developed innovation and entrepreneurship programs that reached thousands of students. A new generation of innovation experts came to prominence. Start-up founders and community activists alike argued that every stale and oppressive element of the status quo stood to be positively disrupted.

Then came the backlash.

Techlash

The growth of innovation culture was the result of a decades-long persuasion process during which its evangelists encountered only limited resistance. In the 1970s, for example, scientists had criticized the National Science Foundation (NSF)’s innovation programs, arguing that the government should stay away from commercialization and stick to fundamental research. Engineering professors likewise had dismissed entrepreneurship education as a marginal activity. Technology journalists had developed the trope of technology entrepreneurs as socially awkward nerds and geeks. In the 1980s and 1990s, the occasional skeptical economist challenged the long-term benefits of regional innovation schemes. After the 2000 dot-com crash, business insiders and late-night television hosts ridiculed misbegotten ideas like Pets.com. On the whole, however, innovation culture amassed power and support.

The growth of innovation culture was the result of a decades-long persuasion process during which its evangelists encountered only limited resistance.

In the early 2010s, innovation culture experienced its first sustained challengers. In 2011, the same year that the NSF released its strategic plan “Empowering the Nation Through Discovery and Innovation” and Isaacson published his bestselling biography of Steve Jobs, a set of influential books criticized the “privatization” of science, the “delusion” of technology fixes to societal problems, and the “corrosive” psychological and social impacts of entrepreneurial work. The Oscar-winning movie “The Social Network” meanwhile probed the dark side of innovators, dramatizing Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg’s rise to power.

Still, innovation skepticism remained a fringe position.

During President Obama’s second term, challenges to specific elements of innovation culture coalesced into a synthetic critique. Leftist intellectuals led the attack. In 2014, the New Republic’s Evgeny Morozov called innovation a “naive fetish” and pointed to the concept’s bipartisan support as an indicator of its vapidness. In 2015, technology historian Lee Vinsel cast himself as a digital-age Martin Luther in his biting essay “95 Theses on Innovation.” At the height of the 2016 presidential campaign, populist critic Thomas Frank excoriated liberalism’s “excessive hope” and called Obama a puppet of the “Innovation Class.” According to Frank, this “rapacious” cult rationalized capitalist inequality through its worship of “credentialed expertise,” meritocracy, and education as the basis of social change. A series of digital magazines including Baffler, Aeon, and Jacobin focused their critiques on innovation culture’s flawed ideology and its detrimental impacts on labor. Inside the academy, historian Benoît Godin established the journal NOvation for the growing specialty of “critical innovation studies.”

This innovation revolt was part of a broader Techlash that revived the antitechnology genre of the 1960s. The Techlash linked the digital order to surveillance, racism, environmental destruction, and the death of democracy. Scholars, investigative journalists, disenchanted technologists, and activists published hundreds of articles and dozens of books critical of innovation culture. Perhaps nowhere was this debate more prominent than on the social media platforms such as Twitter that the critics simultaneously used to gain a following and to target.

The entertainment industry also turned against innovation. The HBO satire Silicon Valley, for example, began in 2014 with a cast of nerdy down-on-their-luck innovators out to slay corporate giants; but as the series unfolded, it revealed innovation culture’s endemic rot and made the case that every participant was complicit. By the end of the 2010s, there was a thriving commercial market for docudramas that included The Social Dilemma, We Crashed, and at least four exposés on disgraced Theranos founder Elizabeth Holmes.

As the country reached new levels of partisan rancor during the 2016 election, “Big Tech” became a shared epithet of the left and the right. Critics with opposing politics shared the same insults, comparing innovation culture to drugs and venereal disease.

Critics on the left sought to dismantle the monopolistic power of the “tech giants,” their tax avoidance, and inhumane working conditions. They also accused social media companies of putting profits over people, resulting in lax security and misinformation, which Russian actors exploited during the 2016 election. Rightwing politicians and pundits meanwhile railed against “woke capitalists” in innovation regions that had spread from California and Massachusetts into Texas, Colorado, Georgia, and other conservative states. They attacked the tech industry’s use of H1-B visas as a form of sweatshop labor and amnesty for immigration. The conservative media outlet The Federalist, for example, published over 500 articles on how “Big Tech Oligarchs” corrupted children, colluded with China, stifled competition, censored freedom of speech, hurt public health, and supported terrorism.

The Techlash also brought a dramatic reversal in representations of innovators. Popular media replaced glowing profiles of entrepreneurial heroes with takedowns of greedy and rapacious villains. There were lowlifes such as hedge fund “pharma-bro” Martin Shkreli, whose business model was to purchase out-of-patent drugs and raise their prices by as much as 5,000 percent. There were disgraced disrupters, like ride-sharing Uber cofounder and CEO Travis Kalanick who was forced to resign amid revelations of ethical violations and sexual harassment. There were frauds, like Theranos CEO Elizabeth Holmes, who The New Yorker had once praised for “democratizing healthcare” with her rapid and inexpensive blood tests but who had deceived patients and investors from the beginning. Finally, there were robber barons and supervillains — Jeff Bezos, Mark Zuckerberg, and Elon Musk — whose achievements were as undeniable as they were unavoidable. These billionaires had amassed so much wealth and power that they existed above the law and normal society.

What’s wrong with innovation?

After World War II, experts celebrated innovation as the answer to society’s biggest questions: how new ideas were created, how wealth emerged, and how the world could be changed. The Techlash challenged these pillars of the innovation consensus. Where innovation experts saw a harmonious synthesis of technology and culture, critics identified a destructive neoliberal order.

At the core of the innovation imperative was a belief in the society-changing power of digital technology. In the late 1950s, technology managers at Bell Laboratories promoted innovation to describe the blurring of science, technology, and society that had given rise to the transistor and, along with it, hybrid technoscientific careers. Engineers, entrepreneurs, and journalists carried this vision westward, portraying Silicon Valley as the leading edge of a decentralized, creativity-based future.

In contrast, anti-innovation experts in the 2010s argued that the relentless pursuit of digital technology had resulted in a misallocation of the nation’s talent. Critics argued that from kindergarten to college, the American education system overemphasized STEM careers at the expense of well-rounded citizens. Addictive social media networks brought record users and profits while the nation’s infrastructures crumbled. Designers built gadgets for the innovation class, while residents of Flint, Michigan, drank poisoned water.

Another promise of the innovation consensus was that its experts could accelerate the uptake of desirable social and technological changes. From Everett Rogers to Richard Florida, innovation experts offered models that capitalized on the relationship between ideas and social and material change.

Designers built gadgets for the innovation class, while residents of Flint, Michigan, drank poisoned water.

During the Techlash, however, critics accused these gurus of peddling a bankrupt ideology. The expert takedown became its own genre in which “delusion” became the newest buzzword. Urban theorists accused Florida of selling false hopes to struggling regions and normalizing the pathologies of booming cities. Science and technology studies scholars declared design-thinking to be an imperialist ideology. “Disruption” was the dirtiest term of all. In The New Yorker, historian Jill Lapore attacked her Harvard colleague Clayton Christensen, calling his vision of disruptive innovation a misguided “gospel.” The rhetoric of religious conflict was a common framing; innovation culture was a cult, its leaders were corrupt prophets, and its aspiring innovators were brainwashed disciples.

Another foundational claim of the consensus was that innovation was the driver of economic growth. Ever since economist Robert Solow had identified technical change as the secret to productivity, bureaucrats, corporate boosters, and politicians advocated for the right mix of regulatory reforms and government incentives to foster entrepreneurial activity, industrial policy, and regional clusters.

In the 2010s, a range of critics instead assailed innovation policy as an engine of inequality. Rather than a perpetual flourishing of start-ups, they claimed that the digital economy produced unregulated monopolies that throttled competition. The resulting concentration of wealth and power produced a stratified economy with billionaires at the top and an expanding service class at the bottom. Innovation hubs like San Francisco, Boston, Seattle, Austin, and Washington, DC, became playgrounds for the rich that were unaffordable for anyone else. Competition for talent in universities was fierce, resulting in a similar divide between winners and losers. However, despite 40 years of efforts to diversify the innovation economy, racial and gender discrimination persisted. These inequities at every level strained the credulity of claims that social and technological progress proceeded in harmony.

Critics further challenged the productivity gains ascribed to innovation. The economist Tyler Cowen made the case that the United States had reached a “great stagnation.” In “The Rise and Fall of American Growth,” economist Robert Gordon, a former student of Solow’s, added credibility to the argument, showing that the rate of overall innovation had been in decline since the 1970s. The conservative pundit Ross Douthat amplified the message, concluding that “21st-century growth and innovation are not at all what we were promised that they would be.”

Even innovation’s champions identified worrisome trends. In 2013, for example, MIT assembled a task force to revisit its Reagan-era Made in America project. The “Making in America” report documented the ongoing decline of manufacturing despite decades of public–private initiatives and lamented the persistence of regional inequality. “Our own initial lofty conceptions of innovation,” the MIT Commission concluded, had been “brought down to American earth.”

The final, unifying pillar of the innovation consensus was that its mindsets and methods were a path to civic renewal. Ever since the democratic experiments of John Gardner in the 1960s, experts had claimed that public–private alliances could change lives and build meaningful relationships. These programs focused on education reform and community development with the goal of extending innovation’s benefits to those previously excluded.

Critics of civic innovation, however, found dashed dreams and unfulfilled promises at every level. In 2017, after participating in a “progressive” project to create a public school for underserved students via a collaboration between educators and game designers, the anthropologist Christo Sims offered a scathing picture of failure. He argued that a fetish for technological solutions reinforced the status quo and that the “professional fixers” behind innovation-centric programs used a toxic form of idealism to ignore their failures while continuing to spend taxpayer money.

Stanford Social Innovation Review’s David V. Johnson similarly argued that the Obama administration’s courting of young technologists into government service created a “revolving door for our new Establishment.” At the global level, former management consultant Anand Giridharadas attacked philanthropic foundations as tools for burnishing the reputation of innovation culture’s corporate winners.

The general conclusion among critics was that innovation was, at best, a Pollyannaish strategy doomed to fail and, at worst, a deliberate strategy for maintaining the status quo.

Phantom limb study rewires our understanding of the brain

NIH scientists and collaborators reveal the brain preserves its representation of lost limb in clinical study.

Image During MRI scans, participants moved their hand (pre-amputation) or phantom hand (post-amputation), as well as their lips (both before and after). Brain maps of the hand (red) and lips (blue) are shown for two pre-amputation scans (pre1, pre2) and multiple post-amputation time points: 3 months, 6 months, and 1.5 years. The maps look the same at each time point demonstrating the stability of the brain’s body map after amputation. Hunter Schone

In a first-of-its-kind study, researchers found that the brain’s control center for a lost appendage can persist long after surgical amputation, which stands in stark contrast to longstanding theories about the brain’s ability to reorganize itself, also known as plasticity. Scientists from the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and their colleagues examined human brain activity before and after arm amputation and found that the loss of a limb does not prompt a large-scale cerebral overhaul. Published in the journal Nature Neuroscience, this study offers new insight into the mysterious phantom limb syndrome and could help guide the development of neuroprosthetics and pain treatments for people with limb loss.

A team of scientists from NIH and University College London acted on a unique window of opportunity, running MRI scans on three participants in the months prior to a planned amputation (performed for separate medical purposes) and then up to five years after.

“It’s not often you get the chance to conduct a study like this one, so we wanted to be exceedingly thorough,” said co-author Chris Baker, Ph.D., of NIH’s National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH). “We approached our data from a variety of angles and all of our results tell a consistent story.”

Different regions in the brain’s outermost layer, called the cortex, are responsible for managing specific body parts. A prevailing theory among neuroscientists has been that, when a body part is damaged or lost, the cortex will remap itself, with neighboring regions associated with intact body parts encroaching on the newly available real estate.

“For many decades, cortical remapping as a response to amputation has been a literal textbook example of brain plasticity,” Baker said.

This corner of neuroscience has not been without debate, however. One sticking point with this theory is the pervasive phantom limb syndrome, wherein a patient feels vivid, often painful, sensations in a now missing extremity.

Baker and his co-authors took this phenomenon as a hint that the brain may remember what it lost. To find out for sure, the researchers needed to do something unprecedented; compare individuals’ brain activity before and after their amputation.

After many years of actively searching for and screening patients that were already scheduled to undergo amputation, the researchers identified three participants who could help answer their questions.

Twice before the planned arm amputations, the scientists scanned participants using a special type of MRI, called functional MRI, to map brain activity triggered by the tapping of individual fingers. In the months and years following the surgeries, the researchers conducted three follow-up scans on the participants as they attempted to perform the same tasks, now with their phantom limb.

The researchers then compared brain activity in search of any major changes between pre- and post-amputation data, but it quickly became clear that there was little to no difference. Had the authors not already known when the data was collected, Baker explained, then they likely would not have been able to tell the difference between the brain maps.

The team’s analysis was not limited to human eyes, however. The authors found that a machine learning algorithm — trained to identify movements of the fingers from pre-amputation data —had no trouble distinguishing which phantom finger was being moved after amputation.

The researchers also learned that nearby brain circuits associated with lip and feet movement did not migrate into the phantom limb’s territory. Additional analyses comparing their data to scans of able-bodied controls, as well as to other studies entirely, only continued to bolster their initial impression; the brain’s representation of the lost limb endures.

These results potentially improve our understanding of how phantom limb syndrome manifests and suggest that standard phantom pain treatments — many of which assume cortical reorganization after limb loss — may be worth rethinking. According to the study’s lead author, Hunter Schone, Ph.D., who conducted this research while a graduate student at NIH, the findings could also be key in how we implement transformative brain-computer interface technologies.

""This study is a powerful reminder that even after limb loss, the brain holds onto the body, almost like it’s waiting to reconnect in some new way,” said Schone. “Now, rapidly developing brain-computer interface technologies can operate under the assumption that the brain's body map remains consistent over time. This allows us to move into the next frontier: accessing finer details of the hand map, like distinguishing the tip of the finger from the base, and restoring the rich, qualitative aspects of sensation, such as texture, shape and temperature.”

After more than 50 years of rapid growth, the nation’s immigrant population is now in decline.

In January 2025, 53.3 million immigrants lived in the United States – the largest number ever recorded. In the ensuing months, however, more immigrants left the country or were deported than arrived. By June, the country’s foreign-born population had shrunk by more than a million people, marking its first decline since the 1960s.

A new Pew Research Center analysis of Census Bureau data finds that, as of June 2025:

51.9 million immigrants lived in the U.S.

15.4% of all U.S. residents were immigrants, down from a recent historic high of 15.8%.

19% of the U.S. labor force were immigrants, down from 20% and by over 750,000 workers since January.

Starting in mid-2024, several policy changes have affected the U.S. immigrant population:

In June 2024, President Joe Biden announced new restrictions on asylum applications , leading to a sharp decline in border encounters with immigrants seeking asylum protections.

, leading to a with immigrants seeking asylum protections. In his first 100 days since returning to the White House in January, President Donald Trump took 181 executive actions on immigration to curtail the arrival of new immigrants and deport noncitizen immigrants. The full effects of these policies remain to be seen, but already they are contributing to a declining immigrant population – especially the unauthorized immigrant population .

How we did this Pew Research Center conducted this analysis to answer common questions about immigration to the United States and the U.S. immigrant population. The immigrant or foreign-born population consists of people born outside of the United States or its territories who are not U.S. citizens at birth. Estimates for 2025 are from Pew Research Center tabulations of the Census Bureau’s monthly Current Population Surveys, accessed through IPUMS. The Current Population Survey’s June 2025 estimate was the most recent available as of July 31. Note that the recent downward trend in the estimated U.S. immigrant population may in part be due to technical reasons such as declining CPS survey participation among immigrants. Data on characteristics and legal status of U.S. immigrants in 2023 comes from Center analysis of augmented and supplemented 2023 American Community Survey data (IPUMS). The analysis also includes historical data from decennial censuses. The estimates presented in this research for 2023 are the Center’s latest. The 2023 ACS was supplemented to take into account the Census Bureau’s 2024 revisions to their population estimates based on increased levels of net international migration. Read the methodology of this report for more details. Comparative data on other countries around the world comes from the United Nations’ migrant stock and overall population estimates for 2024.

Pew Research Center regularly publishes research on the U.S. immigrant population and international migration trends. Here are answers to some key questions about U.S. immigrants, based on the most recent detailed data available. (In some cases, this data is from mid-2023.)

How many people in the U.S. are immigrants?

As of June 2025, 51.9 million immigrants lived in the U.S., making up 15.4% of the nation’s population. This was down from January, when there were a record 53.3 million immigrants in the U.S., accounting for 15.8% of the country’s population – the highest percentage on record.

Even as the nation’s immigrant population has declined in recent months – a change that may be partly artificial due to a declining survey response rate among immigrants – the U.S. is home to more immigrants than any other country.

As of 2024, the second-largest immigrant population is in Germany, numbering around 17 million, according to the latest estimates from the United Nations.

While the U.S. is home to the largest number of immigrants, dozens of countries (including Germany) have a higher proportion of immigrants in their populations than the U.S. does. In neighboring Canada, for example, immigrants account for 22% of the population. And in the United Arab Emirates, about three-quarters of all residents were born elsewhere.

Where are U.S. immigrants from?

As of mid-2023 – the latest year for which detailed data is available – more than 11 million U.S. residents were born in Mexico, representing 22% of all immigrants nationally. The second-largest immigrant group was from India (3.2 million, or 6%), followed by China (3 million, or 6%), the Philippines (2.1 million, or 4%) and Cuba (1.7 million, or 3%).

About half of all U.S. immigrants (52%, or 26.7 million people) were born in Latin America. In addition to the millions of migrants from Mexico and Cuba, more than a million hail from El Salvador (1.6 million), Guatemala (1.4 million), the Dominican Republic (1.4 million), Colombia (1.2 million), Honduras (1.1 million) and Venezuela (1.1 million).

After Latin America, Asia is the second-largest region of birth for U.S. immigrants. In 2023, around a quarter of all immigrants (27%, or nearly 14 million people) were born in Asia.

As of 2023, there were about 11 million immigrants from every other world region combined, accounting for 22% of the U.S. foreign-born population: 10% were born in Europe, 5% in sub-Saharan Africa, 4% in the Middle East-North Africa region, and 2% in Canada or another North American country (a category that includes Bermuda and some smaller countries).

How have immigrants’ origins changed in recent years?

An unprecedented number of immigrants – more than 11 million – arrived in the U.S. between 2020 and 2025. That included more than 3 million in 2023 alone, the largest annual total ever recorded, according to a Center analysis of government data sources.

Alongside this increase, immigrants’ origin regions have also shifted, with a growing share coming from South America and Europe and a declining share coming from Asia and sub-Saharan Africa.

Between 2021 and 2023, 20% of newly arrived immigrants were from South America, up from 13% in the period between 2015 and 2019. Another 12% of new arrivals between 2021 and 2023 were from Europe or Canada, up from 9% in the earlier period.

At the same time, 24% of new arrivals between 2021 and 2023 were from South and East Asia, down from 29% in 2015-19. And 5% of new arrivals between 2021 and 2023 involved people from sub-Saharan Africa, down from 8% in 2015-19.

Mexico was the largest origin country for immigrants who arrived between 2021 and 2023. About 11% of immigrants who came to the U.S. during this period were born in Mexico. Rounding out the top five countries of origin for immigrants who arrived during this period were India (8%), Venezuela (7%), Cuba (6%) and Colombia (5%).

Throughout this period, unauthorized immigrants accounted for most new immigrant arrivals, with many coming from Central and South America.

How have immigration flows changed over the longer term?

Since 1965, more than 76 million immigrants have come to the U.S.

Before then, U.S. immigration law favored immigrants from Northern and Western Europe and mostly barred immigration from Asia. The 1965 Immigration and Nationality Act opened up immigration from Asia and Latin America. The Immigration Act of 1990 further increased legal immigration and allowed immigrants from more countries to enter the U.S. legally.

Immigration flows after 1965 have been larger and come from different and more countries than earlier flows:

From 1840 to 1889, about 90% of U.S. immigrants came from Europe, including about 70% from Germany, Ireland and the United Kingdom.

Almost 90% of the immigrants who arrived from 1890 to 1919 also came from Europe. But their origins were largely different as nearly 60% came from Italy, Austria-Hungary and Russia-Poland.

Since 1965, about half of U.S. immigrants have come from Latin America, with about a quarter from Mexico alone. About another quarter have come from Asia. Large numbers have come from China, India and the Philippines.

Today, Mexico remains the largest origin country among U.S. immigrants. However, immigration from Mexico has slowed since 2007, and the Mexican-born population in the U.S. has since dropped. The Mexican share of the U.S. immigrant population declined from 29% in 2010 to 22% in 2023.

What is the legal status of immigrants in the U.S.?

As of 2023, 46% of immigrants were naturalized U.S. citizens. Nearly a quarter (23%) were lawful permanent residents, often referred to as “green card holders,” and another 4% were lawful temporary residents who were permitted to stay in the U.S. for a limited period of time, usually for work or study. The remaining immigrants in the U.S. fell into the “unauthorized” category and constituted 27% of all U.S. immigrants.

14 Million in 2023

Who are unauthorized immigrants?

Unauthorized immigrants are those without full legal status. As of 2023, this population hit a new record high of 14 million. Within this group, about 6 million (or a little more than 40%) had some form of temporary protection from deportation, with some also having a permit to work in the U.S.

Among the unauthorized immigrants with some deportation protections were 2.6 million asylum applicants; 700,000 people who entered the U.S. legally after receiving parole; 700,000 victims of crime and violence; 650,000 people with Temporary Protected Status (TPS), a program available to immigrants from countries facing war, natural disasters and other crises; and 600,000 immigrants who were brought to the U.S. illegally as children and are enrolled in the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program.

Another 1 million migrants encountered U.S. Border Patrol before being released into the U.S., typically with an order to appear in immigration court. These immigrants have had more limited protections from deportation while their cases are being resolved.

Immigrants in these groups are included as part of the “unauthorized” population because their deportation protections are temporary and can quickly change. For example, the Trump administration has rescinded deportation protections and work permits for about 500,000 immigrants from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua and Venezuela who entered the U.S. legally.

The remaining unauthorized immigrants in the U.S. as of 2023 (about 8 million) had neither legal status nor temporary protection from deportation.

This year, policy and enforcement changes likely contributed to a decline in the unauthorized immigrant population between January and June. Border crossings have fallen further, reaching lows not seen since the 1960s. Immigration arrests and deportations have increased. And a growing number of immigrants have lost deportation protections, with some likely leaving the country voluntarily.

Do all lawful immigrants choose to become U.S. citizens?

Immigrants who are lawful permanent residents and meet other requirements can apply to become U.S. citizens through the naturalization process. During the 2024 fiscal year, 818,500 immigrants became U.S. citizens through naturalization.

Millions of lawful permanent residents are currently eligible to become U.S. citizens but have not applied for naturalization.

How many immigrants are working in the U.S.?

Between January and June 2025, the number of immigrants living and working in the U.S. declined. But recent figures by legal status are not yet available.

In 2023, the most recent year with complete data, 33 million immigrants were in the U.S. workforce, including about 23 million lawful immigrants and 10 million unauthorized immigrants.

Nearly one-in-five workers (19%) were immigrants in 2023, up from 15% two decades earlier. This share increased steadily since at least 1995, when they made up 12% of the labor force.

About 2% of adult immigrants, including noncitizens, are currently serving in the military or served in the past.

Where do most U.S. immigrants live?

In 2023, most of the nation’s 51.8 million immigrants lived in just four states. California was home to 11.3 million immigrants, or 28.4% of the national total. Texas had the second-largest immigrant population with over 6 million foreign-born residents, followed by Florida (5.4 million) and New York (5.0 million).

A majority of immigrants lived in only 12 metropolitan areas. The New York City metropolitan area was home to the largest population, accounting for 13% of all immigrants. The Los Angeles and Miami metro areas also had particularly large immigrant populations, with 9% and 6% of all U.S. immigrants, respectively.

How educated are immigrants?

Overall, immigrants in the U.S. had lower levels of educational attainment than their U.S.-born counterparts in 2023.

24% of immigrant adults ages 25 and older had not completed high school, compared with 7% of the U.S.-born population.

However, immigrants were as likely as the U.S. born to have a bachelor’s degree or higher (36% each).

Educational attainment among immigrants varies widely based on their region of origin:

Only 11% of Central American immigrants hold a bachelor’s degree or higher. By comparison, 36% of U.S.-born adults have this level of education.

Immigrants from Asia, Europe, the Middle East-North Africa region, sub-Saharan Africa and other North American countries are more likely than the U.S. born to have at least a bachelor’s degree.

How well do immigrants speak English?

About half of immigrants ages 5 and older (52%) are proficient English speakers, meaning they either speak English very well or speak only English at home.

Again, there is a wide range of English proficiency depending on where immigrants were born:

The overwhelming majority of immigrants from elsewhere in North America (97%) or from Oceania (83%) – primarily Australia and New Zealand – are proficient English speakers.

Large shares of immigrants from sub-Saharan Africa (75%), South Asia (72%) and Europe (72%) also are English proficient.

On the opposite end of the spectrum, only about one-in-three immigrants who were born in Central America (31%) are proficient in English.

English proficiency is more common among immigrants who arrived in the U.S. before 2000 than among those who entered the country later. Some 57% of immigrants who came to the U.S. before 2000 are proficient English speakers, compared with 47% who arrived in 2010 or later.

https://www.forbes.com/sites/jeffkauflin/2025/08/21/this-ai-fueled-startup-is-helping-attorneys-find-new-class-action-lawsuits/,"Darrow is striking it rich by scouring the internet for corporate misdeeds. But one of its revenue sources—sharing legal awards—raises ethical concerns among some lawyers.

At first glance, a 2021 lawsuit against dating app Bumble seemed like a run-of-the-mill data privacy case. The company was accused of collecting and storing Americans’ face scans without their consent, which was illegal in Illinois, where the lawsuit was filed. While denying the allegations, Bumble settled the case for $40 million. Now, thousands of Bumble users are receiving about $1,900 apiece as compensation. The plaintiffs’ attorneys are getting an even bigger payday, taking home $14 million.

Beyond the large payout, what makes the case unusual is the way it came about. The alleged violation at issue was discovered by five-year-old Israeli tech startup Darrow, which uses artificial intelligence to scour the internet for arguably illegal–and more importantly, class-action-lawsuit-worthy–corporate behavior. It spots the seeds of a suit in different places, such as online consumer complaints or (in the Bumble case) an app’s privacy policies. Then it compares its findings to laws and regulations to gather ideas for class action lawsuits.

Darrow sells the ideas to attorneys and even helps them find people to become plaintiffs for a case through targeted digital advertising. The novel approach is a striking example of how AI is reaching remote niches of industries and transforming them (or at least speeding them up and making them more efficient). AI is already widely used by lawyers for such functions as reviewing masses of documents or emails turned over during discovery in a legal case. But the notion of using AI to discover legal causes of action is a new one. Chicago lawyer and Darrow customer Katrina Carroll, who was the lead attorney in the Bumble case, says Darrow has “enabled me to file cases that I would never have filed were it not for their expertise.”

Cofounder and CEO Evyatar Ben Artzi, 35, sports a thick, philosopher-like beard and makes grandiose statements about Darrow’s mission. He says he wants to create “a world of frictionless justice … where you don’t have to look over your shoulder to see who’s screwing you … where it’s easy to do business, because risk is transparent.”

It's expensive for attorneys to find and file class actions, since they require a lot of upfront research. Ben Artzi wants Darrow to lower the cost of legal services and expand “access to justice.” The CEO and his cofounder, Gila Hayat, 30, named the company Darrow after Clarence Darrow, the famous American lawyer who took on underdog clients such as John Scopes, a high school teacher accused of breaking a law against teaching evolution, and child murderers Leopold and Loeb.

Ben Artzi thinks about legal risks in a very financial sense–as an asset. “Any legal risk is a future cash flow with some kind of probability weight to it. All you need to do is surface these opportunities, give them to the experts that can handle them–whether that’s a company or a law firm–and let them create the right trade, so to speak.” Beyond selling to law firms, Darrow wants large companies to buy its services so they can see their own legal vulnerabilities and fix them.

Darrow’s business model is intriguing. The company makes money the same way many software firms do, by charging customers both subscription and usage-based fees. But it also has a more controversial revenue source. When lawyers win cases originated with a Darrow idea, the startup quietly takes a cut of the lucrative attorneys’ fees. It does that through a little-known partnership with Arizona lawyer Don Bivens, which is enabled by a 2020 administrative order by Arizona’s Supreme Court that removed an ethical rule and allowed Arizona law firms to share attorneys’ fees with non-lawyers.

Two lawyers who are Darrow customers told Forbes that Darrow requires them to include Bivens as co-counsel in any case that originates from the startup’s research. Bivens has full oversight over Darrow’s case recommendations: He helps decide which law firms to pitch them to, reviews them before they’re sent out and supervises how the advertising will work to find plaintiffs.

Darrow’s chief revenue officer, Mathew Keshav Lewis, doesn’t like discussing this setup. When we asked repeated questions about it, he was evasive and said Darrow doesn’t disclose its “commercial agreements.” Bivens, who passes a chunk of his attorneys’ fees back to Darrow, confirmed the arrangement to Forbes. (Lewis added that Darrow’s partnerships vary by jurisdiction and that some of its customers don’t co-counsel with Bivens, without elaborating further.)

Lewis says his skittishness stems from a fear that competitors will copy Darrow’s model, and from sensitivity around ethical rules about sharing attorneys’ fees with non-lawyers. In at least 47 U.S. states, ethical guidelines prohibit non-lawyers from sharing in attorneys’ fees. Some lawyers argue convincingly that the rules are outdated and protectionist. Either way, Lewis and Bivens insist that Darrow isn’t doing anything improper and that the tech company has no say in lawyers’ decisions on a case. They say Darrow is just providing “legal intelligence,” or information and data to support a case, like any other consultant regularly does.

Regardless of what anti-fee-sharing sticklers might think of its business model, the 156-person startup has been growing quickly. It counts 80 law firms as customers and charges them between tens of thousands of dollars and millions of dollars a year for its services, Ben Artzi says. The company’s revenue reached $26 million in 2024, and he expects it to surpass $50 million this year. “In 2026, we'll do $120 million of revenue,” he predicts, adding that the startup has been cash-flow positive since 2023. “In Israel, we're the biggest legal tech company. Definitely the most profitable and revenue-generating.”

Several lawyers we spoke with are convinced that Darrow is onto something and will ultimately be one of many companies offering AI-powered lawsuit-idea services. Says Jeffrey Cunningham, a legal ethics attorney and partner at law firm Cohen Vaughan: “I think in 10 years, this is going to be normal.”

B en Artzi grew up in Israel, and during four years of military service, rose to become a major, leading 250 special combat operations soldiers. He went to law school afterward and became a clerk at the Israeli Supreme Court, but he was frustrated by the slow, reactive nature of the legal system and the way lawsuits originated. “The awareness layer of the system is really limited to what people will insert in there. It's not doing anything proactive,” he says today.

In 2020, he met Gila Hayat, who had been a data scientist in Israel’s elite 8200 military intelligence unit and had used AI to analyze large amounts of data. The pair cofounded Darrow that year with seed funding from Barak Rabinowitz, an Israeli venture capitalist at F2 who holds more than a 10% stake in Darrow.

Today, Darrow’s models uncover different flavors of possible violations, with many involving data privacy. Darrow once found out that a hospital was sharing confidential patient data, including consumers’ medical conditions and illness symptoms, with online advertisers like Google and Facebook. It also regularly finds instances of employers offering poorly performing, high-fee mutual funds in their 401(k) plans, which could constitute violations of ERISA, the 1974 law that sets standards for private, employer-sponsored retirement plans.

Darrow’s technology uses its own home-grown models and foundational models from the likes of OpenAI and Anthropic, tailoring them to give outsize weight to legal rules. When it recommends a class action case idea to a lawyer, Darrow estimates how many consumers were harmed, how many millions of dollars the settlement would likely fetch and its likelihood of success.

Many of Darrow’s staffers are techies working in research and development who also have legal training. “Our people are weird hybrids,” Ben Artzi says. “Think about the standard Israeli ex-intelligence, Unit 8200 kind-of-person who then went to law school.” The startup tries to identify 100 to 200 new cases per quarter and insists that it steers clear of suggesting frivolous cases to law firms.

It’s hard to tell to what degree the revenue-sharing aspect of its business might turn customers off, hampering its growth. The ethical rules prohibiting the practice were formally adopted in the 1980s by U.S. state bar associations, whose leaders feared that non-law-firm companies cared primarily about money and weren’t morally obligated to do right by the end client. Regulatory changes to these rules have been made in Puerto Rico, Washington, D.C., Washington State, Utah and Arizona, which is why Bivens has no qualms about discussing it. Fee sharing with non-lawyers is legal in the U.K. and Australia, too.

But in America, the practice is still taboo among some attorneys. One lawyer we spoke with said the revenue-sharing practice deterred him from working with Darrow.

Bivens thinks the stigma is misguided. He says revenue-sharing law firms can easily avoid ethical transgressions by making sure the business side doesn’t meddle in attorneys’ work. “If I were to let a non-lawyer influence my decision about what's in the best interest of the client, I'd have to be disbarred. The lawyer has an independent duty to the client, and nobody can interfere with that.”

B oulder, Colorado-based startup Justpoint also uses large language models and AI to find lawsuit ideas, but of a different sort. Cofounded in 2018 by Victor Bornstein, who has a Ph.D. in biomedical sciences, it analyzes millions of medical records to find cases where pharmaceuticals are producing harmful, little-known side effects. Instead of class actions, Justpoint focuses on mass torts, or lawsuits where consumers are harmed to varying degrees, resulting in different payouts for different plaintiffs. Mass tort settlements are often larger than class actions. For example, decades-long litigation involving people harmed by asbestos has racked up tens of billions of dollars in settlements.

To get its piece of the juicy attorneys’ fees, Justpoint takes a different approach: It has its own law firm, Justpoint Law, that is (of course) based in Arizona. So tech startup Justpoint, with its staff of 260 people, refers cases only to Justpoint Law, with its four employees, two of whom are lawyers. Bornstein says Justpoint has brought six mass tort cases involving 13,000 claims. It has only settled “a small fraction” of those so far, with an average payout of $355,000 per claimant. Six months ago, Bornstein raised $45 million in Series A funding for Justpoint.

Ben Artzi isn’t content to stick with class actions at Darrow–he’s now trying to expand into mass torts and to sell Darrow’s “legal intelligence” to large corporations. It’s a hard sell, though. Companies want to know about some risks, but not all of them, because they’re legally bound to fix an infraction once they’re aware of it, Lewis says. A company subscribing to Darrow’s service would also have to get comfortable with the awkward reality that, if Darrow finds a misdeed big enough to warrant a lawsuit, the startup might be tipping off both the offending company and a law firm that could sue it.

https://www.propublica.org/article/rfk-jr-autism-environment-research-funding,"Erin McCanlies spent almost two decades at the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health studying how parents’ exposure to chemicals affects the chance that they will have a child with autism. This spring, Robert F. Kennedy Jr. eliminated her entire division.

Reporting Highlights Slashed Autism Funding: RFK Jr. promised to identify the causes of autism but has eliminated parts of his agency actively investigating them and has cut millions in funding for autism research.

RFK Jr. promised to identify the causes of autism but has eliminated parts of his agency actively investigating them and has cut millions in funding for autism research. Silent on Rollbacks: Once an ardent environmentalist who took on big polluters, RFK Jr. has been silent on Trump’s dismantling of efforts to combat climate change and pollution.

Once an ardent environmentalist who took on big polluters, RFK Jr. has been silent on Trump’s dismantling of efforts to combat climate change and pollution. Conflicting Priorities: RFK Jr. helps lead an administration that is reversing regulations on pollution and chemicals, including some linked to autism. These highlights were written by the reporters and editors who worked on this story.

Erin McCanlies was listening to the radio one morning in April when she heard Robert F. Kennedy Jr. promising to find the cause of autism by September. The secretary of Health and Human Services said he believed an environmental toxin was responsible for the dramatic increase in the condition and vowed to gather “the most credible scientists from all over the world” to solve the mystery.

Nothing like that has ever been done before, he told an interviewer.

McCanlies was stunned. The work had been done.

“That’s exactly what I’ve been doing!” she said to her husband, Fred.

As an epidemiologist at the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, which Kennedy oversees, McCanlies had spent much of the past two decades studying how parents’ exposure to workplace chemicals affects the chance that they will have a child with autism. Just three weeks earlier, she’d been finalizing her fourth major paper on the topic when Kennedy eliminated her entire division. Kennedy has also overseen tens of millions of dollars in cuts to federal funding for research on autism, including its environmental causes.

For 20 years, Kennedy has espoused the debunked theory that autism is caused by vaccines, dismissing evidence to the contrary by arguing that vaccine manufacturers, researchers and regulators all have an interest in obscuring their harms.

He remains skeptical of the scientists who have been funded by his own agency to study the neurodevelopmental condition. “We need to stop trusting the experts,” he told right-wing host Tucker Carlson in a June interview, going on to suggest that previous studies that found no relationship between vaccines and autism were marred by “trickery” and researchers’ self-interest.

In contrast, Kennedy told Carlson that under his leadership, and with a new, federally funded $50 million autism research initiative, “We’re going to get real studies done for the first time.”

Some autism researchers fear that the effort will manipulate data to blame the condition on vaccines. “Kennedy has never expressed an open mind, an open attitude towards what are the fundamental causes of autism,” said Helen Tager-Flusberg, a Boston University psychologist who founded a coalition of scientists concerned about his approach to autism. In a June statement, the group said the initiative lacks transparency and that Kennedy “casually ignores decades of high quality research that preceded his oversight.”

As Kennedy promotes his new initiative, ProPublica has found that he has also taken aim at the traditional scientific approach to autism, shutting down McCanlies’ lab and stripping funding from more than 50 autism-related studies. Meanwhile, he has stood by as the Trump administration encourages the departure of hundreds of federal employees with experience studying the harm caused by environmental threats and rolls back protections from pollution and chemicals, including some linked to autism.

Kennedy did not respond to requests for an interview, and an HHS spokesperson did not answer specific questions from ProPublica, including those related to the concerns of the coalition of autism scientists. “Under the leadership of Secretary Kennedy, HHS is taking action on autism as the public health emergency it is,” the spokesperson wrote. “NIH is fully committed to leaving no stone unturned in confronting this catastrophic epidemic — employing only gold-standard, evidence-based science. The Department will follow the science, wherever it leads.”

Genetic factors account for a significant portion of autism cases. Research like the kind McCanlies and other government-funded scientists have conducted over the past two decades has established that environmental factors have a role, too, and can combine with genetics. Multiple factors can even converge within the same individual. Some of those environmental risks could be reduced by the very measures the Trump administration is rolling back.

Kennedy would have been well positioned to advocate for researchers looking into the environmental causes of autism while sitting on President Donald Trump’s cabinet.

The nephew of President John F. Kennedy and son of his former attorney general, Bobby, Kennedy spent decades as an attorney battling some of the world’s most notorious corporate polluters. Once heralded by Time Magazine as one of the “heroes for the planet,” he railed against actions by the first Trump administration, complaining in his 2017 introduction to the book “Climate in Crisis” that 33 years’ worth of his work was “reduced to ruins as the president mounted his assault on science and environmental protection.”

But recently he has remained publicly silent as the Environmental Protection Agency halts research and weakens regulations on air pollution and chemicals, including some McCanlies and her colleagues have identified as possible factors in the development of autism.

“I don’t think he’s aware of my work,” McCanlies said, “or most of the literature that’s been published on what the causes of autism are.”

McCanlies was studying how a toxic chemical, beryllium, causes chronic lung inflammation in workers when she began to think seriously about autism.

It was 2005, and her college-age stepson had a job shadowing children with autism. As he described helping them navigate playground dynamics, reminding them to return a wave or a greeting, McCanlies wondered whether their behaviors might be tied to chemicals their parents had encountered on the job. Could the exposures have altered genes their parents passed down? Could they have infiltrated the kids’ developing brains through the womb or through breast milk?

The questions remained abstract until McCanlies met another researcher named Irva Hertz-Picciotto, who had a unique data set. She had collected detailed information on the occupations of two large groups of parents: those who had children with autism and those whose kids developed neurotypically. Comparing the groups’ chemical exposures before their children were born could help illuminate causes of the condition, McCanlies realized.

Hertz-Picciotto, an environmental epidemiologist based at the University of California, Davis, was a pioneer in the search for the causes of autism. In 2009, she published a much-cited paper highlighting a sevenfold increase in diagnoses in California. While others had asserted the rise was due to increased awareness and broadened diagnostic criteria, Hertz-Picciotto found those factors could only partially explain it. She and others went on to document additional contributors to autism risk, including parental age at the time of birth, a mother’s fever during pregnancy and more traditional environmental considerations, such as chemical exposures.

McCanlies hadn’t studied autism. But she offered Hertz-Picciotto her experience in genetics and epidemiology as well as the considerable resources of her agency. NIOSH was established in 1970 to investigate the dangers of the workplace, and its statisticians and industrial hygienists were among the world’s experts on the health impacts of chemical exposures.

Their first collaboration, published in 2012, used Hertz-Picciotto’s data to see if parents of children with autism were more likely to have been exposed to chemicals already thought to be dangerous to the developing brain. The work was technical and time-consuming, but the analysis showed a clear relationship: Mothers and fathers of children with autism were more likely than the parents of unaffected children to have been exposed to solvents such as lacquer, varnish and xylene on the job. These solvents evaporate quickly and can be easily inhaled or absorbed through the skin. Chemical plant workers, painters, electricians, plumbers, construction workers, cleaners and medical personnel are among those who may be exposed to these solvents.

The sample size was small — just 174 families. But the results lined up with recent findings showing possible links between autism and exposure to metals and certain solvents during pregnancy or early childhood, including a solvent called methylene chloride. They also tracked with studies linking the chemicals to miscarriage, reproductive problems, birth defects and developmental problems other than autism.

McCanlies and Hertz-Picciotto followed up with a 2019 study that looked at more than 950 families. It showed that women exposed to solvents at work during pregnancy and the three months leading up to it were 1.5 times more likely to have a child with autism than women not exposed to the chemicals. (The study did not find a link for chemically exposed men.)

Their third study, published in 2023, took the link between solvent exposure and autism as a starting point. Using blood samples to examine the genetic makeup of the parents of children with autism, McCanlies and Hertz-Picciotto found that when exposed to solvents on the job, people with specific variants of 31 genes had an especially elevated risk of having a child with autism. Their genetic makeup appeared to increase the risk that solvents by themselves posed. Some of those 31 genes help cells connect with one another; others play a role in helping cells migrate to different areas so they can grow into the various parts of the brain; still others ensure that cells clear away toxic substances.

Researchers were also making strides under the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, a division of Health and Human Services, which has financed investigations into dozens of environmental contaminants. Several have been linked to autism, including air pollution, certain pesticides, a plastic additive known as BPA and diesel exhaust, which causes “autism-like behavioral changes” in mice. In 2021, Hertz-Picciotto co-published a study linking “forever chemicals” called PFOA and PFNA with the condition. (In 2023, a second paper also found an association with PFNA.) Other government-funded research has established a link between autism and another solvent, trichloroethylene, also known as TCE, which has been used for dry cleaning, manufacturing and degreasing machines.

Together, the results have shown that many exposures can increase the likelihood of autism, and that there can be multiple causes for any one person.

At least one exposure can have the opposite effect: A study by a researcher named Rebecca Schmidt — and funded by the NIEHS and NIH — found that a B vitamin called folic acid was associated with a significant decrease in the chances of an autism diagnosis. More than a dozen studies have since confirmed the association.

One problem hung over much of autism research. The sweeping diagnosis includes everyone from people who treasure their neurological differences to those with debilitating symptoms, including repetitive behaviors, excruciating sensitivity to touch and sounds, and difficulty responding to social situations. McCanlies and Hertz–Picciotto wondered whether certain chemicals were linked to the most severe cases or to specific symptoms.

In 2023, they set about finding out.

They were preparing to submit their study for publication when newly inaugurated Trump put Kennedy in charge of America’s health.

Despite having made chronic health conditions the focus of his agenda, Kennedy has quietly abided environmental policies that will exacerbate these problems, including autism.

The Environmental Protection Agency, under Administrator Lee Zeldin, is rolling back rules and regulations that will result in an increase in air pollution, which multiple studies have linked to autism. The agency is in the process of reversing bans on several chemicals, including TCE, one of the solvents associated with the disorder, and has told a federal court it won’t legally defend certain aspects of a ban on methylene chloride, another of the solvents linked to autism. It also began dismantling its Office of Research and Development, which has funded research into the environmental conditions contributing to autism. According to an EPA spokesperson, more than 2,300 workers have so far elected to leave the agency through Trump administration programs encouraging early retirement and resignation.

The EPA also began canceling grants, including one it had given to Schmidt, the researcher who studied the protective effect of folic acid. Schmidt had been awarded $1.3 million to determine whether air pollution from wildfires might increase the risk of various neurological conditions. Schmidt and her colleagues had just done preliminary analysis and found that there was a significant association between wildfire pollution exposure and autism when she received a letter saying that the grant was terminated because the project was “no longer consistent with EPA funding priorities.” After a judge ruled in a class-action lawsuit on behalf of University of California researchers alleging their funding was unlawfully terminated, her grant was reinstated last month. But the EPA has appealed the judge’s ruling, leaving Schmidt unsure about the fate of the project.

Schmidt said there is an urgent need to finish the study and warn people about how to avoid the dangers from wildfire smoke by staying indoors and using air filters and N95 masks. “Millions of pregnant women are getting exposed as we speak,” she said.

Meanwhile, Kennedy has presided over his own gutting of research. Known for sharing videos of his bare-chested workouts, he likened his agency’s cuts to getting rid of “unhealthy fat,” but his plan to reduce the staff of HHS by 20,000 amounts to slashing the workforce by roughly a quarter, including veteran scientists. Among the divisions Kennedy eliminated was one that studied air quality and collected data on chemicals found in human blood. Some workers in the division were subsequently reinstated. After a lawsuit and pressure from Congress, HHS has also rehired some NIOSH workers, though none at the division where McCanlies worked. Those whose jobs have not been reinstated remain on administrative leave.

The reorganization plan for HHS involves consolidating the remnants of these parts of the agency, along with several others, into a new division called the Administration for a Healthy America. Asked about the transition, an HHS spokesperson told ProPublica in an email that the reorganization would save taxpayers $1.8 billion a year and that “critical programs will continue.”

Meanwhile, a ProPublica review of federal data found that more than $40 million in grants awarded by the National Institutes of Health for dozens of autism-related research projects were canceled under Kennedy’s watch. Some had been awarded to universities the administration is now targeting, while others ran afoul of Trump’s “anti-woke” priorities by mentioning gender and other verboten terms. Among them was a grant to Harvard University to use data on nearly half a million Israeli children to evaluate whether men’s exposure to air pollution affects the risk of having a child with autism. (A small number of grants have been recently reinstated.) A survey of researchers conducted by the Autism Science Foundation, which tallied cuts to training grants and the anticipated cuts to future grants over the next few years, estimated that the total loss of funding could be tens of millions more.

“We’re talking about probably decades of delays and setbacks,” said Alycia Halladay, chief science officer at the Autism Science Foundation. “To take money away from all these areas of need to focus on a question that the HHS director considers high priority seems not scientific and not the way that science is done.”

Housed under the National Institutes of Health, Kennedy’s new $50-million Autism Data Science Initiative is looking to fund two- to three-year research projects that plumb large public and private datasets to find “possible contributors to the causes of autism” as well as conduct research on existing treatments.

With the deadline for his promised discovery fast approaching, Kennedy recently acknowledged that his initial six-month timeline was overly optimistic. He told Carlson he should have “some initial indicator answers” about the causes of autism by September, his original deadline, and promised unqualified answers within another six months.

While the NIH typically releases the names of the scientists on the committees that review grant applications and the criteria they use to review them, it has not done so in this case. Nor has the agency clarified what role NIH staff will have in awarding the grants, who will make the final selection, or what terms and conditions researchers must agree to if they receive funds. HHS did not respond to ProPublica’s questions about who will make the final grant selection and why the agency has not yet made this information public, but a video NIH created for applicants of the funding acknowledges that reviews of the proposals “do not follow the traditional NIH review process.” According to the video, the process was “designed to ensure integrity, fairness and transparency.”

Hertz-Picciotto, who laments the fact that Kennedy is “shutting down good studies,” is among the researchers in her field who have decided to apply for the funding. “Some of his agenda is really ridiculous and very counterproductive,” she said. “But if something good can be done with this money, I’d like to be part of that.”

If her project is approved, she plans to hire McCanlies to consult on it.

McCanlies said she agreed to work on the project because she has complete confidence in her longtime colleague, if not the health secretary. “I don’t trust him at all,” she said.

McCanlies had never paid much attention to Kennedy — or to politics. Throughout the seven presidential administrations that governed while she had been at NIOSH, her work had been utterly uncontroversial. But weeks after his confirmation, she knew her job was in peril. She had deleted the first email she received from Trump’s Office of Personnel Management. The tone was so strange and disrespectful, hinting that she might be punished if she didn’t respond by confirming her email address, that she assumed it was a phishing attempt. By the time she received a second, suggesting that she find a “higher productivity” job in the private sector, firings and budget cuts were rolling across federal agencies.

The 58-year-old, who has short, greying hair, hazel eyes and three graduate degrees, hadn’t been ready to leave NIOSH’s Health Effects Lab in Morgantown, West Virginia, a place where she had mentored young colleagues, taught a lunchtime meditation class and helped conduct several yearslong research projects. The lab is also where she met Fred, her husband, another Ph.D. scientist who studied workplace chemical hazards. She reluctantly put in for early retirement just days before the entire lab was dissolved.

McCanlies spent her final days at NIOSH finishing her last paper, which explores the association between workplace chemicals and the severity of autism. Normally, she would have her supervisor sign off on her submission to a journal, but he had already lost his job. The rest of her colleagues were gone, too, and the lab’s hallways were empty as she gave the manuscript a final edit.

She felt proud of the study, which answered some of the questions she and Hertz-Picciotto had posed years ago. There were indeed links between exposures and the severity of autism. Parents’ exposure to plastics was “consistently and significantly associated” with lower cognitive scores in their children who had autism, increases in “aberrant behaviors” and deficits in basic life skills, the study found. The exposure was also linked to particular symptoms of autism, including social withdrawal, hyperactivity and repetitive behaviors such as hand flapping and body rocking. Higher autism severity scores and weaker daily living skills were also linked with ethylene oxide. Last year, the EPA imposed stricter limits on the chemical, which is used as a sterilizer. But the agency is now reconsidering those restrictions, and, in July, Trump exempted some of the biggest polluters from them.

The paper, which is now available as a preprint, recommended that regulatory agencies “consider increasing awareness of these hazards and make clear recommendations for implementing protective measures at the worksite.”

https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2025/08/18/how-the-audiences-of-30-major-news-sources-differ-in-their-levels-of-education/,"The American audiences of 30 prominent news sources vary dramatically in their levels of education, according to a recent Pew Research Center survey.

Roughly six-in-ten U.S. adults (62%) who say they regularly get news from The Atlantic have at least a bachelor’s degree. Axios, NPR and The New York Times also have audiences with relatively high levels of formal education: More than half of adults who regularly get news from these outlets have a college degree. Overall, 36% of all U.S. adults are college graduates.

By comparison, Univision and Telemundo – the two major Spanish-language TV networks included in our survey – have the lowest percentages of college graduates in their audiences at 15% and 16%, respectively. Most Americans who regularly get news from these outlets are Hispanic, and Hispanic adults in the United States are less likely to have a college degree than U.S. adults overall (20% vs. 36%).

How we did this Pew Research Center conducted this analysis as part of a larger study tracking news consumption and trust across a wide range of news sources. We regularly ask people about their news habits on various platforms (e.g., television, print, radio and digital) and their levels of trust in information from social media and national/local news organizations in general. This study was designed to be more specific, looking at Americans’ familiarity with, usage of and views toward 30 individual news sources. For this analysis, we surveyed 9,482 U.S. adults from March 10 to 16, 2025. Everyone who took part in both surveys is a member of the Center’s American Trends Panel (ATP), a group of people recruited through national, random sampling of residential addresses who have agreed to take surveys regularly. This kind of recruitment gives nearly all U.S. adults a chance of selection. Interviews were conducted either online or by telephone with a live interviewer. The survey is weighted to be representative of the U.S. adult population by gender, race, ethnicity, partisan affiliation, education and other factors. Read more about the ATP’s methodology. Here are the questions used for this analysis, the topline and the survey methodology. For a full breakdown of education levels within the audience of each news source, refer to this detailed table.

How we chose these 30 news sources We selected 30 news sources based on a variety of measures, including audience size and previous survey results. We also wanted to prioritize a range of news sources across different platforms, as well as both legacy news outlets and nontraditional news sources, all while keeping the list from becoming too long for survey respondents. This selection process is not perfect; we acknowledge that no list of 30 sources could represent the entirety of today’s diverse and changing media environment. We believe this group of 30 provides an appropriate snapshot of media brands to help us study Americans’ changing news habits. To learn more, read the FAQ and methodology.

When it comes to major broadcast TV networks, about three-in-ten U.S. adults who regularly get news from NBC News (32%), ABC News (31%) and CBS News (30%) are college graduates. This is just below the national level of U.S. adults with bachelor’s degrees. These three networks are all among Americans’ most common sources of news, according to our survey.

CNN and Fox News also rank among the nation’s most popular news sources. CNN’s audience has a similar percentage of college graduates (38%) as U.S. adults overall, while Fox News has a somewhat lower share (27%).

A few other news sources with predominantly Republican audiences – including the Tucker Carlson Network, Newsmax and The Joe Rogan Experience – have similar shares of regular news consumers who are college graduates as Fox News.

Republican voters are generally less likely than Democratic voters to have a college degree. But these differences in audiences’ educational levels aren’t just the result of partisan preferences for different outlets. Even within each party, the audiences of various news sources have widely different levels of educational attainment. For example, Republicans who regularly get news from The Wall Street Journal are much more likely to have a college degree than Republicans who regularly get news from CBS News.

https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/steve-gunn-music-for-writers/,"Steve Gunn’s new album is called Music for Writers, and I’m listening to it right now because I’m a writer who’s writing something. What does Gunn, who emerged as a low-key guitar hero in the early 2010s by bringing a bit of avant-garde flair to roots music, envision as writerly music? Largely ambient, it turns out. These compositions feature lots of drones that float softly in the air around you, lots of instruments that dissipate into vapor, and lots of negative space to fit whatever environmental noises you might hear while listening. For me those noises have included the sound of passing cars muffled by noise-canceling earpods and the white noise of coffeehouse chatter, but right now, as I’m writing this very sentence, it consists almost entirely of the resigned shrumpfs and schnorfles of a dog stretching out on the couch beside me. Music for Writers is background music that mingles with whatever is in your foreground, which is one of the defining qualities of ambient music.

But the album aspires to be much more. It aims to inspire creativity and reflection, to ignite synapses, to spur you along in whatever writerly endeavor you might be undertaking. It’s meant to exist somewhere between atmospheric and meditative; in a statement, Gunn writes that he hopes the music will be “a ground for thought, a companion for work, daydreaming, grief, happiness, sadness, or simply a place to rest.” That makes it something new in Gunn’s catalog.

Music for Writers is the Brooklyn-based musician’s first fully instrumental album, the first that does not make use of his measured vocals or lyrics about movement and travel. So it’s also his first that’s grounded not in storytelling, but in scene-setting and evocation; it’s all about vibe. Finally, this is his first experimental album under his own name, a departure from his established folk/rock sound that doesn’t involve a collaboration of some sort. Interspersed among his solo albums are pairings with David Moore of Bing & Ruth, Mike Cooper, the Black Twig Pickers, and Hiss Golden Messenger. They’ve all allowed him to explore different corners of his world or to chase random ideas from electronica to folk revival. Here he chases them by himself.

Because solitude is so crucial to the record—Gunn played all the instruments himself during sessions in Brooklyn, Berlin, and Latvia—his palette is minimal: electric and acoustic guitars, synthesizers, some field recordings, and lots and lots of reverb. He strips away the building blocks of his sound, including the spidery fretwork that has become his signature, and replaces them with new sounds and new techniques. “Cat” contains the figure that most resembles a melody or riff, but even that dissolves into a kind of stream-of-conscious picking, as though the cat itself were dictating the notes. A repeating keyboard theme puts a little bob and bounce into “Slow Singers on the Hill,” even as it seems to change shape constantly—almost like saying a word over and over until it loses meaning.","Sentiment score 0.20000000298023224 , Sentiment Magnitude 7.099999904632568","name:background music type: 5 Salience 0.1479329913854599, name:Steve Gunn type: 1 Salience 0.13740751147270203, name:writer type: 1 Salience 0.07922240346670151, name:musician type: 1 Salience 0.0563671737909317, name:album type: 5 Salience 0.03273971006274223, name:departure type: 4 Salience 0.028654498979449272, name:music type: 5 Salience 0.018576472997665405, name:guitar hero type: 1 Salience 0.011123580858111382, name:cars type: 6 Salience 0.004485694225877523, name:Writers type: 1 Salience 0.0037594616878777742, name:ground type: 2 Salience 0.0034821273293346167, name:companion type: 1 Salience 0.0032161588314920664, name:Brooklyn type: 2 Salience 0.0029491172172129154, name:statement type: 5 Salience 0.0028248820453882217, name:somewhere type: 2 Salience 0.0028248820453882217, name:guitars type: 6 Salience 0.0028216198552399874, name:couch type: 6 Salience 0.0028105885721743107, name:lyrics type: 5 Salience 0.002585327485576272, name:evocation type: 2 Salience 0.0025825602933764458, name:palette type: 5 Salience 0.0023303874768316746","Category:/Arts & Entertainment/Music & Audio/Rock Music , Category_confidence:50.0%"
https://buildingsaltlake.com/seg-to-build-new-6000-seat-venue-in-new-downtown-entertainment-district/,"Salt Lake City’s new entertainment district between the Delta Center and the Salt Palace Convention Center could have a new fixture in the near future: a 6,000-seat indoor music venue.

Smith Entertainment Group announced Tuesday it would partner with Live Nation — one of the largest entertainment companies in the world — to build a new indoor music venue as part of the ongoing efforts to create a new entertainment district Downtown.

Michael Rapino, Ryan Smith and Ashley Smith during the Tuesday press event announcing the new music venue.

The new 6,000-seat indoor venue is “the first of many major announcements regarding SEG’s plans” for the entertainment district between the two venues, according to a Tuesday news release from SEG.

“Our goal has always been to bring enormous opportunities to downtown,” said Ryan Smith, SEG chairman and CEO, in the news release. “Once the transformation of Delta Center was underway, partnering with Live Nation on what a world-class concert venue could look like in downtown became a top priority. Not only will it bring the best artists in the world to Utah, but it will also bring a million people downtown to experience Salt Lake City every year.”

During a press conference Tuesday, Smith sat alongside SEG co-founder Ashley Smith and Live Nation CEO Michael Rapino to announce the new venue. Ryan Smith said that once renovations began to the Delta Center, one of his first calls was to Rapino to try and get an additional music venue Downtown, saying, “this is the number one target that we want in Downtown Salt Lake to activate our community.”

Rapino credited Ryan Smith for reaching out and getting the ball rolling on the venue. He called the new venue “a rare opportunity,” adding that most of the time new music venues built near sports arenas are hardly ever in a city’s downtown.

Rapino also said that nowadays, a 6,000-seat venue is in a sweet spot for touring artists. While some can sell out arenas and others are more suited for cozy 200-seat venues, many artists look for mid-size venues to perform.

“We wouldn’t have that today,” Rapino said. “We would fly over Salt Lake, as you would call it. It wouldn’t be a market we would play. So this has been open, a great opportunity. We’re thrilled to be part of it.”

A rendering showing the high-level plans for the sports, cultural and entertainment district.

The venue’s mid-size capacity would range from 2,000 to 6,000, the news release says, which would fill a gap in Salt Lake City’s concert market. Many of the city’s indoor concert venues like The Union, Eccles Theater or Abravanel Hall don’t have capacities above 4,000 — while larger venues like the Delta Center or West Valley City’s Maverik Center can each comfortably hold over 10,000 guests.

In addition to being a music venue, the news release also says the venue would be able to host, “a variety of corporate, conference, and community events.”

When answering questions from reporters, Ryan Smith said the venue would be a joint venture between SEG and Live Nation, adding the latter would be the main operator of the venue.

Despite the Tuesday announcement, SEG doesn’t have specified plans of where the venue would be located in the entertainment district, nor what the overall block could look like.

Mike Maughan, an executive at SEG, said Tuesday that there’s no set location for the music venue, adding that the company is in the, “early stages now of identifying architects of mid block will be putting together our phasing plan, (and) we know that this will be a central component.” Maughan added portions of the Salt Palace are slated for demolition starting in Q1 of 2027.

The Tuesday announcement is the latest development for the area’s planned overhaul that’s been funded largely with taxpayer money. More recently, the Utah Department of Transportation confirmed 300 West would be reconstructed to allow the street to go beneath a pedestrian plaza, though the street wouldn’t be buried as deep as 200 West.

Despite the large influx of taxpayer funds that have already been set aside for the project, Maughan didn’t specify how the new concert venue would be funded. When asked, Maughan said, “SEG has committed $3 billion to the downtown, and both Live Nation and SEG will be committing substantial funds to this investment as part of this music and entertainment venue.”

SEG is currently building an 89-foot, 452-stall parking structure to the southwest of the Delta Center and fronting 100 South, which was just recently approved by the Salt Lake City Planning Commission.

After the event, Salt Lake City Mayor Erin Mendenhall told Building Salt Lake the new venue will be a great addition to the city’s entertainment scene that will enhance year-round activation of Downtown.

“This is a new tool in the belt of what downtown is becoming,” Mendenhall said. “It’s not a duplicative venue. It brings a new sort of level of the entertainment spectrum that is, as Michael (Rapino) said flying over Salt Lake City otherwise.”

In the news release, SEG makes clear there will be future announcements detailing the entertainment plaza, though detailed plans have not been made public.

“Both SEG and Live Nation will be committing considerable financial investment into the development of this venue,” Smith said in the release. “This is the first of many announcements as we continue to work at attracting the best and most influential brands in the world to invest in our state.”

Did you hear the noise enveloping the pop music world last week? A squeal met by a sigh: the collision of excitement and exhaustion could only mean one thing. Taylor Swift was on her way back to center of the discourse, a new album cover (concealed, of course, in a monogrammed custom case) under her arm. Last Monday's public notice that The Life of a Showgirl's physical existence would be officially revealed the next day on New Heights, the podcast hosted by Swift's boyfriend, Travis, and brother-in-love, Jason Kelce, sent fans into a Pavlovian tizzy and critics into an equally knee-jerk downward spiral. Swifties took mere minutes to begin reading clues (""easter eggs,"" you all know the lingo) in the blurry imagery posted on Swift's website: the glittery orange background fulfilled the promise of the vermillion door leading away from the stage at the end of her Eras tour shows; a TikTok posted last fall showing Swift in a stadium section labeled A12 was now proven to be a signal of the day she would announce her return. By the time Swift actually made that podcast appearance, sweetly and seriously discussing her life with Kelce and recent victory in the battle for her master recordings, and announced pre-orders on her website, the egg hunt was in full swing.

Meanwhile, non-Swifties were doing their usual thing: bitching about Swift's inability to take a truly restorative break from cultural world domination. She might not need time to rest and enjoy life with her GQ cover man, but we do. Showgirl, this argument goes, will again strong-arm the discourse as click-hungry media outlets focus on her every move, mainstream pundits (oh hai) will pour out think pieces about how her presence has affected their self-conception/love lives/parenting styles, and every other artist will wonder where the air in the room went. Some negative Nellies tire of Swift the moment they see her because they feel she's a distraction from serious political issues; others dislike her because they think she's too political or an enemy of the alliances they favor. (Swift herself throws off the haters with calm magnanimity.) These objections have nothing to do with Swift's music and only reflect her public presence in the broadest terms — by their logic, the Kelces, Pedro Pascal, Benson Boone and Beyoncé are also a pox on society, keeping us snoozing or pointing us in the wrong direction as the empire collapses.

Then there are people like me, who may see Swift's return as a labor issue. I'm sure many culture writers felt the familiar pressure to quickly produce the first hot take in a series inevitably extending past the album's October rollout. Swift's prolificity isn't that unusual among her peers, though it's considerably enhanced by her re-recordings of past material; her pal Ed Sheeran, for example, has released a new core product coming every two years, augmented by various extras. Several rappers outrun her exponentially, with Gucci Mane holding the crown at 108 releases including mixtapes. The ascendant country star Charley Crockett is another who beats Swift at her numbers game, having released 15 fresh studio albums in half the time the pop star has managed 12. Flooding the market is a business decision for some, a way to deal with the messed-up monetization methods of streaming platforms; for others, it's an aspect of an exceptionally energetic creative life.

Swift is often compared to The Beatles, who over a shorter lifespan, released a similar flood of albums alongside films, mucho merchandise and various side projects. The music industry was very different in the 1960s, but what rings true about this comparison is the work ethic involved — like Swift, the Fabs were methodical and disciplined about making music even at their most personally worn down — and the demands that productivity made on a rock press that recognized readers' inexhaustible desire to track every move their faves made. ""Since a craze is a form of inflation, it may precede a crash,"" a New York Times correspondent wrote hopefully after Beatlemania hit in 1964, and some culture chroniclers never stopped waiting for that crash to happen. (He also expressed fear that the band would become ""the vocal scourge of the whole Western world."")

Like Swift, The Beatles grew up in public, giving even the snobbiest critics more to chew on with every release. Yet it was inevitable that, to some, the group's dominance over pop would begin to feel like a burden. Even as the members' unprecedented success as popular artistes made wider coverage of adventurous pop music more common, it also reinforced a pattern that grew ever more intractable with every passing decade, in which popularity and cultural significance are equated, not only in the moment but as pop's canons and legacies began to be built. If music writers and other supposed gatekeepers breathe wearily around Swift today, it's partly because the vestiges of a hierarchy that commercial realities have long toppled remain lodged within the practice of discernment that expertise represents. It's frankly a fruitless aspect of the work — not discernment itself, which is fundamental, but the maintenance of a binary distinction between what was once called ""high"" and ""low"" art, which now could perhaps be identified as ""mainstream"" and ""niche"" or, if you're feeling righteous (and I often am), ""the 1%"" and ""the marginalized."" The reality is that there's exciting, well-executed art being created at every level of popular culture, and discernment should happen at the level of individual works, though with a constant eye toward how those works are shaped by the economic systems that support or hinder their makers.

What I think is most different about music-driven popular culture now — though not wholly unprecedented — is the gamification of everything. My friend, the scholar and critic Eric Harvey, put this thought in my mind the day after Swift announced Showgirl, when he posted a response to fellow arts writer Sam Adams' bitter Bluesky comment about the dwindling of the critic's role in mainstream publications. ""For decades now, people have been conditioned to view popular culture as something to 'solve' and the answer keys are on Reddit and YouTube,"" Harvey wrote. ""So why pay critics to essentially give people homework to do?"" That rang a bell in my brain. The idea that criticism or any kind of ""expert"" commentary might distract fans from their enjoyment of their favorite music, rather than illuminating it, made me think about what it means when we turn art appreciation into a game with a desired outcome, whether it's picking up the most easter eggs or, as in museums who provide children with placards that direct them through galleries, identifies the biggest number of preselected details within designated masterpieces. The never-ending egg hunt is a big part of what non-Swifties find exhausting about her rollouts — it takes up an enormous amount of space in the public consciousness. It does something else, too: It trains fans to appreciate art in a particular way. Loving Showgirl, for some fans, is all about deciphering its signals in predictable ways, with the outcome being a solution rather than a surprise. Art becomes something you master, rather than something that affects and potentially changes you.

Don't get me wrong: I know that many Swifties are deeply enriched by her music and engage with it as a way of better understanding their own lives. And some are even listening with musically attuned ears, noticing her hard work as a songwriter and in the studio, where she's one of the more meticulous and subtly inventive pop stars we've ever had. But the noise overwhelming her signals is all about the game. With every new release, Swifties engage as numerologists and map readers first and only as listeners long after the fun has begun. And they're doing so under the direction of a master, as I'm not the first to note. No one has grasped better than Swift how music in the attention-deficit century requires a multi-media frame to keep people engaged. (On Monday, to announce the new vinyl variants for Showgirl, she baited fans once again with a countdown clock on her website.) As early as 2012, when she swathed her rollout for Red in crimson at well-orchestrated fan events, Swift has been taking cues from contemporary phenomena like Harry Potter and the Marvel Comics Universe to create a virtual world around her music, and to make that world an eminently solvable mystery.

Swift hardly invented this approach; fans did, with some help from earlier stars who encouraged their obsessions while also being somewhat irked by them. The whole ""Paul is Dead"" thing around the bass-playing Beatle was a kind of gamification. So was the search for the meaning of Led Zeppelin's ""runes"" album title. Prince sometimes planted hidden messages in his videos and songs. Madonna created scripts for her alter egos. In 2006, Trent Reznor even created a LARP-ing game to enhance the rollout of the Nine Inch Nails album Year Zero. K-pop's rise came about, in part, because that industry so seamlessly integrated online gaming with music; that's how we got to KPop Demon Hunters. Focusing on the game-like aspect of musical projects, or building them in to define and extend the parameters of those projects, makes fans feel deeply connected to their idols and to each other.

Despite the fact that fans have always made music loving into a game, and that artists have historically engaged with that process in creative ways, the dominance of gamification within music is relatively new. It suits generations who grew up playing video games and learning basic skills like reading and math, in part, from educational adaptations of the same diversions. Anyone Swift's age or younger could very well comprehend the world primarily in terms of gaming, the way a bookworm learns about it through reading or an athlete does through the lessons of her body and of team interaction. Given this, making art into a game feels legitimate. But art can also be very different from most games, in that it can be open-ended; it can be something that people abide with, letting its meanings grow and change, rather than ""solving"" it. I think that's what Eric Harvey's comment laments — the loss of a sense of art as having meaning that is unfixed, unlimited. As a fan of Swift's albums, I've found many moments that fulfill that definition within her recorded work. But I'm not always sure her presentation of that work encourages such richly personal and varied interpretations.

I could be wrong here. I believe Swift is a true artist, devoted to the process first, whether that's writing all the time, spending endless hours in the studio or giving 110% during her performances. Her interest in gamification is an aspect of her total absorption in the creative process. She's said during her New Heights appearance that she will never gamify her personal life; every egg she hides in the grass of the agora leads back to her songs, not the gossip pages. She does want people to think of her as a musician first, not as an avatar. Yet her successful method for continually amplifying her efforts — exemplified by that appearance on her partner's podcast (as he welcomed the ratings boost it would bring) to debut her latest offering — illustrates the difficulty this most 24/7 pop star has with separating work and love, work and play. She's hinted that while Showgirl will be a happy album that makes people want to dance, it will also explore the experience of being Taylor Swift across the whole game board of her life. I'm looking forward to hearing how her new music connects the pieces.","Sentiment score 0.10000000149011612 , Sentiment Magnitude 32.70000076293945","name:Showgirl type: 1 Salience 0.4370720684528351, name:Swift type: 1 Salience 0.023314589634537697, name:Swifties type: 1 Salience 0.019235236570239067, name:squeal type: 1 Salience 0.01449623517692089, name:music type: 5 Salience 0.009297163225710392, name:TikTok type: 1 Salience 0.007636677008122206, name:fans type: 1 Salience 0.00663274759426713, name:Charley Crockett type: 1 Salience 0.005983334966003895, name:Taylor Swift type: 3 Salience 0.004410555120557547, name:others type: 1 Salience 0.004221969749778509, name:people type: 1 Salience 0.0032041813246905804, name:critics type: 1 Salience 0.0031904038041830063, name:articles type: 5 Salience 0.003062925534322858, name:album cover type: 5 Salience 0.0029122030828148127, name:one type: 1 Salience 0.0027147207874804735, name:podcast type: 5 Salience 0.002667503897100687, name:NPR Music type: 3 Salience 0.0026269780937582254, name:center type: 2 Salience 0.00243695848621428, name:imagery type: 5 Salience 0.0024294338654726744, name:master recordings type: 5 Salience 0.002426285995170474","Category:/Arts & Entertainment/Music & Audio , Category_confidence:75.0%"
https://www.buzzfeed.com/kaylayandoli/underrated-unappreciated-movies-films,"""It's a horror/suspense film about two friends who are avid rock climbers and daredevils, one of whom suffered a personal loss and deep depression because of it. To get back on the horse, the other girl challenges her to face her fears and climb an old TV tower with her (which is basically just a 2,000-foot metal pole with a ladder). And of course, things don't go as planned. This movie is gut-churning as they climb the tower, and the photography and editing give you a real sense of height. I'd say I have a moderate/healthy fear of heights, and at times, I definitely had a physical reaction of body-clenching during some scenes (particularly when they hang with bare hands from the top of the tower). Fall is produced by a few people who worked on 47 Meters Down: Uncaged, which was a really good movie. Fair warning: This movie is quite preposterous and has many things you could nit-pick, but avoid that because you'll really enjoy it.""","Sentiment score 0.0 , Sentiment Magnitude 3.4000000953674316","name:rock climbers type: 1 Salience 0.29013028740882874, name:film type: 5 Salience 0.15446987748146057, name:Fall type: 5 Salience 0.0729496106505394, name:one type: 1 Salience 0.06057649105787277, name:daredevils type: 1 Salience 0.04339449480175972, name:girl type: 1 Salience 0.043261848390102386, name:people type: 1 Salience 0.009558630175888538, name:movie type: 5 Salience 0.008175153285264969, name:tower type: 2 Salience 0.006801940500736237, name:TV tower type: 2 Salience 0.006776389665901661, name:scenes type: 5 Salience 0.0016502124490216374","Category:/Arts & Entertainment/Movies , Category_confidence:77.0%"
https://thequietus.com/quietus-reviews/deftones-private-music-review/,"I was doomscrolling the other day and a post stuck with me. It sported an article clipped from a magazine. It read “baby born from embryo frozen in 1994, the oldest baby ever”. Someone retweeted the article: “that baby could have been playing tony hawk pro skater 2 and listened to killswitch engage, now he’ll play fortnite and listen to carti”.

I don’t know if it’s just me and my algorithm, but sometimes it feels like the world ended in the early 2010s. This is a silly example of that doomsday feeling, but it’s telling. Many of us remember life back then like this blissful American suburbia of the soul – Myspace, nu metal, Mountain Dew and all – and now it’s no more. It wasn’t really like that, but now it feels as if it were. And we’re left here replaying those muted memories, gurgling through way-too-hi-fi speakers.

I bring this up because this nostalgia colours the new Deftones record, Private Music. As I listened to it, it felt the way that content makes me feel.

It makes sense, of course: Deftones has always been protagonists to that sort of early 21st century nostalgia. Elite members of the nu metal class, they have always been the good shit you remember your older brother blasting through your bedroom walls – especially if it never happened. Deftones is the kind of mallcore you still enjoy with no shame now that you pay your own bills.

But what I did not see coming was just how much Private Music would have felt like an echo of the gilded days. It feels like a fuzzed-out memory of the band itself, a machine built exclusively of salvaged remains.

In simpler terms, on Private Music Deftones sounds just like Deftones, but with something off about them: even compared to their most ethereal numbers, Private Music is blown all the way out. Everything echoes or is covered in fuzz. It sounds like the slowed-and-reverbed version of themselves. In a word, a memory.

Take, for example, ‘infinite source’. It’s quintessential Deftones: huge riffs, booming drums and the saccharine vocals that soar over the mayhem. Easily one of the best tunes they’ve dished out in a while, in a record chockful of the best Deftones in a while. And yet the overall sound comes off as dissociated, like an out of body experience. It has a nocturnal quality that makes it sound more like a recollection rather than an actual song that just came out.

The same goes for ‘milk of madonna’, ‘locked club’ or ‘cut hands’. ‘~metal dream’ and ‘cXz’ even sound like a desperate dub version of a cut straight out of Around the Fur. Most songs come off like Deftones summoning themselves, distant and dusty.

But the most surreal are the slower numbers: ‘I think you all the time’, ‘departing the body’ and ‘the droning souvenir’. Here the band stretches their sound so much that it becomes something rather akin to the nu-shoegaze acts like Wisp – this evanescent disembodied wall-of-sound that’s distinctly Deftones but also not really. A perfect picture smudged by all the years gone by.

So, is it a bad record? Quite the contrary, I’d say. But it’s uncanny. There’s something vampiric about Private Music. It’s the sound of something irreparably lost and grieved.","Sentiment score 0.0 , Sentiment Magnitude 14.899999618530273","name:Deftones type: 3 Salience 0.36242201924324036, name:baby type: 1 Salience 0.06913154572248459, name:Private Music type: 3 Salience 0.032688263803720474, name:post type: 5 Salience 0.027357986196875572, name:Someone type: 1 Salience 0.01853625848889351, name:world type: 2 Salience 0.015275686979293823, name:article type: 5 Salience 0.014989656396210194, name:magazine type: 5 Salience 0.013171549886465073, name:tony hawk type: 1 Salience 0.013060012832283974, name:band type: 3 Salience 0.006625881884247065, name:skater type: 6 Salience 0.0064054084941744804, name:Myspace type: 3 Salience 0.005532623268663883, name:members type: 1 Salience 0.005185713060200214, name:suburbia type: 2 Salience 0.004913691431283951, name:Many type: 1 Salience 0.004913691431283951, name:songs type: 5 Salience 0.003405224299058318, name:song type: 5 Salience 0.0033747137058526278, name:brother type: 1 Salience 0.0033301692456007004, name:machine type: 6 Salience 0.003321671159937978, name:hi-fi speakers type: 1 Salience 0.003304359270259738","Category:/Arts & Entertainment/Music & Audio/Rock Music , Category_confidence:98.0%"

I was very excited that we were about to put out a real record, on a real record label. I was a little scared as well – we were this new band, putting ourselves out there. The label sent us physical copies of Adrenaline when it came out – I think we even got cassettes back then. It was so exciting to open it up and have something tangible to hold. But we had no sense of the longevity it would enjoy. I didn’t anticipate people would still be listening to it, or even that we’d still be a band this many years later. We still have nerves, obviously, whenever we release something. But we also have a sense of confidence, especially with this new record.

Do you find your creativity burns brightest in hardship? Or can peace be just as potent? shenead

There’s something to be said for both, and our music has that dichotomy built into its DNA – a lot of our songs have that yin and yang within them. There’s a lot more peace than chaos in our lives at the moment, and I’m happy it’s that way. A lot of our earlier records were made when life was more crazy, and we were able to capture that. But with this record, there’s some of that beauty that comes with this invigorated time we’re living in now. But it’s always good to be able to yell and scream sometimes, right? The pandemic was really difficult for everybody, but as someone who was spoilt by having this outlet my whole adult life, to be able to tour and play shows and express myself … I really came to a dead stop during Covid. It really affected me. Making music – to be able to express emotions, good and bad – has definitely been a gift.

I work at HMV in a small town and we sell at least five copies of 1997’s Around the Fur to teenagers every week – way more than Fleetwood Mac’s Rumours or Nirvana’s Nevermind. To what do you ascribe its longevity? DameHedwig

I would hope it’s because we made some good records that have been able to transcend time, and that people of all ages find something within them they connect with. It’s probably no different from when I was a kid discovering groups like Led Zeppelin. And I’m not saying that we’re as great as them, but those bands were around for many years before I discovered them. I was able to connect with what they created, and it’s a lovely thing. We’ve always made a constant decision to not date ourselves with the music we make. We were always afraid of being lumped-in with the nu metal groups that came up at the same time we did. Not that we felt we were in another league; we just wanted to have our own identity. So we would make certain creative decisions to try not to fall too deep into any category.

Deftones’ Covers compilation shows a wide range of influences, including a number of British artists from the 1980s such as Duran Duran, the Cure, the Smiths and Sade. How much of an influence were they on your music? JimmyD

It’s the first music that I fell in love with, and it seemed very exotic to me as a sixth-grader. When you’re watching videos by Duran Duran, and they’re cruising on yachts in Sri Lanka, it just seemed like this music from far away. It was the 80s, and this stuff was pop music, but a lot of my friends were listening to Michael Jackson and stuff like that. And I loved that as well, but this British music was different. I felt very … selective, that I had this music that nobody else knew about. And there’s things there that I’ve carried over to Deftones. We’re still a hard rock/metal group, but I’ve snuck some of those influences in. And it’s not shoehorned; it’s very natural, because I genuinely have an affinity with this music.

It seems your recent albums have had deeper, almost occult themes and symbolism. Is this intentional, or just something unconscious coming out through your art? Phronesis

It’s unconscious. I’ve always been intrigued by things we don’t understand. It’s not me buying into any of these things at all – it’s just being curious about that which I don’t understand. I don’t do it for shock value. When I was a kid, my grandmother would go to church, and all of us kids would go to the kids’ church group, where they gave us an illustrated book of stories from the Bible. It had the scariest illustrations. I would stare for hours at these illustrations of, like, King Solomon holding up a baby by its feet. And then I’d read the story, these two people fighting over who the baby belonged to, and Solomon chopping it in half. It boggles me to this day, that it would be something a kid might read. But I’ve always had a curiosity about stuff like that.

What music did you listen to when you were 22? Jlimbless

I was probably touring and listening to a lot of early electronic stuff and trip-hop. I was really into Portishead, Unkle, DJ Shadow and Tricky. I still love that music. It was marrying a lot of things that I love: sample-driven music, drum-forward music. It had a lot of the elements of hip-hop, but slowed down, and there was a lot of romantic imagery within it.

I listen to a lot of the songs from Eros [Deftones’ unfinished sixth album, abandoned after bassist Chi Cheng was left comatose after a car crash in 2008; he died of complications from the accident in 2013] floating around the internet – Dallas especially. Do you think that record will ever see the light of day? weavermachine

We’re always asked about Eros. It will most likely never see the light of day. That would involve going back to that period and resurrecting unfinished things, and somehow bringing them to completion. Dallas is the only song that was anywhere near finished. This new album started with ideas we’d been working on alone, through the pandemic. And when we got together to actually start making the record, none of us wanted to look back at those ideas from the pandemic – we wanted to capture the moment we’re in today. So going back to try to capture what was happening back during Eros, and finishing those ideas, doesn’t really make sense.

Usually for me, it’s the heavier, the better – but then I heard Sextape [from 2010’s Diamond Eyes], which I love (and its mellower parts, especially). What inspired the lyrics, and how did it become the banger it is? danozism

I don’t have any recollection of writing the words. A lot of our songs are written very abstract, to paint a picture of a feeling. There’s three notes that go through the whole of Sextape, and they’re very lush and beautiful – they take that side of us to the extreme. There’s beauty there, in the sonics of it. Lyrically, I just ran with that emotion.

How do you separate your different creative modes between Deftones and your other projects? Mdrudolph

I don’t. Each is its own thing, but I don’t approach them in any different way. I react how Chino would react. What I mean is, there’s no such thing as “Chino from Deftones” and “Chino from Crosses” and “Chino from Team Sleep”. There’s just one Chino. And I just react to what’s presented to me, musically, as myself. [A pause] I don’t often refer to myself in the third person. Actually, I feel like that was the first time. And I felt really weird doing that!

Your cover of the Sade song No Ordinary Love is just otherworldly. Did she ever get to listen to it or give any feedback? Lazygunn

That was sacred ground because, as an artist, Sade’s unique. Even when we were recording it, it felt like a very self-indulgent thing to be doing. We weren’t intending for it to come out. The demo was recorded in my garage; we really just made it for ourselves. The fact that it ever saw the light of day at all was scary, to be honest. If you’d asked me, “Would you want to cover a Sade song, and other people are going to hear it, including possibly Sade?”, I would never have done it. I’m glad people do like it. I’m not sure that she’s ever heard it.

If you could go back in time and offer advice to your younger self, what would you tell him? Zack_S917

There’s a lot of life lessons that I had to learn the hard way, and they created the person that stands here today. I don’t have many huge regrets in life, because it all shaped who I’ve become. That said, it might be nice to go back to a few moments and tap myself on the shoulder and say, “No – go that way.”

You must get a ton of love from fans, and I imagine the gifts can get pretty creative. What’s one of the sweetest or coolest things you’ve received from a fan? StarrXperience

People often give me drawings of myself. I always wonder what they assume I will do with them. I don’t even like to look at photos of myself. They’re all different types of drawings – there’s cartoony ones, pen and ink ones. And I think it must bring the artist some kind of joy, that I’m holding on to a piece of art they created. “You shared your art with me – I want to share my art with you.” I do appreciate it. But because of that, I have stacks and stacks, hundreds of drawings of myself in my house.","Sentiment score 0.10000000149011612 , Sentiment Magnitude 51.599998474121094","name:kid type: 1 Salience 0.8318345546722412, name:music type: 5 Salience 0.006018996704369783, name:Deftones type: 5 Salience 0.004871354438364506, name:songs type: 5 Salience 0.004850455094128847, name:label type: 3 Salience 0.0034773272927850485, name:people type: 1 Salience 0.0032826869282871485, name:hard rock/metal group type: 3 Salience 0.002734534675255418, name:Chi Cheng type: 1 Salience 0.0024627060629427433, name:debut type: 4 Salience 0.002041235100477934, name:Adrenaline type: 1 Salience 0.001843200414441526, name:Dallas type: 2 Salience 0.0015319475205615163, name:someone type: 1 Salience 0.0014341305941343307, name:groups type: 3 Salience 0.0010158291552215815, name:Chino Moreno type: 2 Salience 0.0009889903012663126, name:church group type: 3 Salience 0.0008814691100269556, name:Abe Cunningham type: 1 Salience 0.0008078926475718617, name:Stephen Carpenter type: 1 Salience 0.0008078926475718617, name:Frank Delgado type: 1 Salience 0.0008078926475718617, name:FilmMagic type: 5 Salience 0.0007329271757043898, name:videos type: 5 Salience 0.0007308271597139537","Category:/Arts & Entertainment/Music & Audio/Rock Music , Category_confidence:98.0%"

Editor’s Note: This post highlights data from Webb science in progress, which has not yet been through the peer-review process.

Using NASA’s James Webb Space Telescope, a team led by the Southwest Research Institute (SwRI) has identified a previously unknown moon orbiting Uranus, expanding the planet’s known satellite family to 29. The detection was made during a Webb observation Feb. 2, 2025.

“This object was spotted in a series of 10 40-minute long-exposure images captured by the Near-Infrared Camera (NIRCam),” said Maryame El Moutamid, a lead scientist in SwRI’s Solar System Science and Exploration Division based in Boulder, Colorado. “It’s a small moon but a significant discovery, which is something that even NASA’s Voyager 2 spacecraft didn’t see during its flyby nearly 40 years ago.”

This timelapse animation shows the newly discovered moon of Uranus, designated S/2025 U1, as well as 13 of the 28 other known moons orbiting the planet. The observations by NASA’s James Webb Space Telescope’s NIRCam (Near-Infrared Camera) were taken over the course of about 6 hours on Feb. 2, 2025, under program ID 6379 (principal investigator: M. El Moutamid). The animation is comprised of data taken with NIRCam’s wide band F150W2 filter, which transmits infrared wavelengths from about 1.0 to 2.4 microns. Due to the drastic differences in brightness levels, the animation is a composite of three different treatments of the data, allowing the viewer to see details in the planetary atmosphere, the surrounding rings, and the orbiting moons.

The newly discovered moon is estimated to be just six miles (10 kilometers) in diameter, assuming it has a similar reflectivity (albedo) to Uranus’ other small satellites. That tiny size likely rendered it invisible to Voyager 2 and other telescopes.

“No other planet has as many small inner moons as Uranus, and their complex inter-relationships with the rings hint at a chaotic history that blurs the boundary between a ring system and a system of moons,” said Matthew Tiscareno of the SETI Institute in Mountain View, California, a member of the research team. “Moreover, the new moon is smaller and much fainter than the smallest of the previously known inner moons, making it likely that even more complexity remains to be discovered.”

Astronomers using NASA’s James Webb Space Telescope discovered a new moon orbiting Uranus in images taken by Webb’s NIRCam (Near-Infrared Camera). This image shows the moon, designated S/2025 U1, as well as 13 of the 28 other known moons orbiting the planet. (The small moon Cordelia orbits just inside the outermost ring, but is not visible in these views due to glare from the rings.) Due to the drastic differences in brightness levels, the image is a composite of three different treatments of the data, allowing the viewer to see details in the planetary atmosphere, the surrounding rings, and the orbiting moons.

Hedman (University of Idaho)

The new moon is the 14th member of the intricate system of small moons orbiting inward of the largest moons Miranda, Ariel, Umbriel, Titania, and Oberon. (All the moons of Uranus are named after characters from Shakespeare and Alexander Pope.)

“It’s located about 35,000 miles (56,000 kilometers) from Uranus’ center, orbiting the planet’s equatorial plane between the orbits of Ophelia (which is just outside of Uranus’ main ring system) and Bianca,” said El Moutamid. “Its nearly circular orbit suggests it may have formed near its current location.”

A name for the newly found moon will need to be approved by the International Astronomical Union (IAU), the leading authority in assigning official names and designations to astronomical objects.

“Through this and other programs, Webb is providing a new eye on the outer solar system. This discovery comes as part of Webb’s General Observer program, which allows scientists worldwide to propose investigations using the telescope’s cutting-edge instruments. The NIRCam instrument’s high resolution and infrared sensitivity make it especially adept at detecting faint, distant objects that were beyond the reach of previous observatories,” said El Moutamid. “Looking forward, the discovery of this moon underscores how modern astronomy continues to build upon the legacy of missions like Voyager 2, which flew past Uranus on Jan. 24, 1986, and gave humanity its first close-up look at this mysterious world.

https://www.gq.com/story/every-coen-brothers-movie-definitively-ranked,"For film nerds, they’re simply unfair, the best at every technical element of making movies. In cinematography, sound design, editing, soundtrack, screenwriting, they tower above their peers. They are masters of tone, of spatial language, of communicating story via image pregnant with meaning, of the action set piece. They cast the greatest actors and get some of their absolute best performances out of them. There is a chicken-and-egg component to many of these relationships. They don’t exactly invent Jon Polito, or Sir Roger Deakins, or Hailee Steinfeld or T Bone Burnett, or Roderick Jayne*, or Frances MacDormand, or John Goodman, or Skip Lievsay, or Holly Hunter, or John Tuturro, or Carter Burwell, or Oscar Isaac, but we never look at those people's work the same way as we do in their work with the Coens, or love them quite as much as when they work with other people. Maybe it’s taste that allows them to locate the perfect people for these moments in time and career. Maybe it’s a symbiosis, where they find something in their collaborator or maybe their collaborator is unlocked by the brothers. It’s another unsolvable puzzle in a cold, chaotic, Godless universe.

The following is a ranking of the 21 collected films made so far by my favorite directors who ever lived (solo works included), the recent byproduct of yet another run through their incredible, near-perfect filmography. It won’t be the last. For me, and many sick neurotic people like me, it’s a body of work that contains worlds I find eminently habitable, worlds that change in meaning and shape and significance as I age along with them. They traipse through the 20th and 21st American centuries, the whole history of cinema, and selectively pluck influences and subjects to build postmodern facsimiles of, but these characters really exist alone in their own cartoon pocket universe. Which is why this last viewing experience was one of the best, by brilliant design, as if this was how these films were designed to be watched: In rapid succession, while manically taking notes, over a few weeks.

You pick up interconnected rhymes and echoes, a cinematic universe of cyclical shit you couldn’t have possibly tracked through the 80s, 90s, 2000s and 2010s in real time. A twirling top hat becomes a rolling hula hoop then a spinning hubcap. Herbert I. McDonnough becomes Ulysses Everett McGill. Barton Fink becomes Llewyn Davis. Loren Visser becomes Leonard Smalls, Anton Chigurh, Bob Dylan, a tornado heralding the end of the world. It is one great Mentaculus, a meticulously constructed, circuitous road to nowhere.

There is an unusually subjective, random quality to ranking Coen Brothers films because the quality is so high and the films often incongruent apples or oranges. This time I adhered more closely to the pleasure principle, and tended to gravitate towards the films I loved watching the most in the moment rather than respect for their ship-in-a-bottle construction. But we’re ordering perfection, quite appropriately a fool’s errand. The order very well may be entirely different on the next rewatch. For young readers and the uninitiated, what I would say is this list represents a chalk ranking of the Coen’s works from the vantage point of the middlebrow dumbass fan. It’s a good starting point for you to develop your own list with an obsessive deep dive.","Sentiment score 0.10000000149011612 , Sentiment Magnitude 12.199999809265137","name:masters type: 1 Salience 0.0980384349822998, name:best type: 1 Salience 0.0967068299651146, name:actors type: 1 Salience 0.04975663870573044, name:people type: 1 Salience 0.04939940199255943, name:movies type: 5 Salience 0.027733946219086647, name:directors type: 1 Salience 0.013494960032403469, name:cinematography type: 5 Salience 0.013121883384883404, name:performances type: 4 Salience 0.013010804541409016, name:Jon Polito type: 1 Salience 0.012060284614562988, name:soundtrack type: 5 Salience 0.011530019342899323, name:peers type: 1 Salience 0.011530019342899323, name:piece type: 5 Salience 0.011472794227302074, name:image type: 5 Salience 0.011472794227302074, name:Roger Deakins type: 1 Salience 0.009672034531831741, name:films type: 5 Salience 0.007961343973875046, name:characters type: 1 Salience 0.006826304364949465, name:many type: 1 Salience 0.004916514735668898, name:works type: 5 Salience 0.00481649162247777, name:cartoon pocket universe type: 5 Salience 0.003338106209412217, name:one type: 1 Salience 0.003315435256808996","Category:/Arts & Entertainment/Movies , Category_confidence:91.0%"

https://www.pewresearch.org/journalism/2025/08/20/how-americans-view-journalists-in-the-digital-age/,"Reporters interview House Majority Leader Steve Scalise, R-La., on his way to the House Chamber at the U.S. Capitol on July 2, 2025. (Kevin Dietsch/Getty Images)

How we did this Pew Research Center has been studying how Americans get news and information for many years, and it has become clear that journalists’ place in society has been changing amid major political and technological shifts. So we asked everyday people for their views on this topic, including how they define a “journalist,” how they view journalists’ role in America, and what they want from their news providers more broadly (whether they are journalists or not). We used two different methods to explore Americans’ understandings of what it means to be a journalist in the digital age: Survey We surveyed 9,397 U.S. adults from April 14 to 20, 2025. Everyone who took part in this survey is a member of the Center’s American Trends Panel (ATP), a group of people recruited through national, random sampling of residential addresses who have agreed to take surveys regularly. This kind of recruitment gives nearly all U.S. adults a chance of selection. Interviews were conducted either online or by telephone with a live interviewer. The survey is weighted to be representative of the U.S. adult population by gender, race, ethnicity, partisan affiliation, education and other factors. Read more about the ATP’s methodology. Here are the questions used for this report, the topline and the survey methodology. Focus groups Pew Research Center worked with PSB Insights to conduct nine 90-minute online focus groups with a total of 45 U.S. adults from June 10 to 18, 2025. These discussions are not nationally representative, and the results are not framed in quantitative terms. This report includes findings and quotes from the focus groups to help illustrate and add nuance to the survey findings. Quotes were lightly edited for spelling, punctuation and clarity. To learn more, refer to the methodology.

As Americans navigate an often-overwhelming stream of news online – some of it coming from nontraditional news providers – what it means to be a journalist has become increasingly open to interpretation.

That is apparent in several ways in a new Pew Research Center study. Who Americans see as a “journalist” depends on both the individual news provider and the news consumer, similar to the variety of ways people define “news.”

There is a lack of consensus – and perhaps some uncertainty – about whether someone who primarily compiles other people’s reporting or offers opinions on current events is a journalist, according to a new Center survey. Americans are also split over whether people who share news in “new media” spaces like newsletters, podcasts and social media are journalists.

In some ways, Americans’ ideas about journalists are still tied to what the news industry looked like in the 20th century. When asked who comes to mind when they think of a journalist, many everyday Americans who participated in our focus groups said they think of traditional TV newscasters like Walter Cronkite and Tom Brokaw, modern anchors like Lester Holt and Anderson Cooper, and even fictional characters like Clark Kent.

Most Americans say journalists are at least somewhat important to the well-being of society. At the same time, many are critical of journalists’ job performance and say they are declining in influence, an opinion that follows years of financial and technological turmoil in the news industry. And many views toward journalists continue to be sharply divided by political party, with Republicans taking a more skeptical view of the profession than Democrats.

As part of our broader study of how Americans get news and information nowadays, we wanted to know what people think about the role of journalists in the digital age – including what makes someone a journalist, what Americans think is important for journalists to do in their daily work, and what backgrounds and attributes people are looking for in their news providers broadly (whether they are journalists or not). So earlier this year, we posed these questions in a survey of more than 9,000 Americans and in online focus groups with 45 U.S. adults.

Americans want honesty, accuracy and topical knowledge from their news providers

What do people want their news providers to be like, regardless of whether they are journalists? Honesty, intelligence and authenticity are the top three traits in our survey that respondents say are important for the people they get news from to display in their work.

However, as our focus group discussions illustrate, people hold differing views of what the term “authenticity” means when it comes to news providers – and some aren’t entirely sure.

Americans also care more that someone they get news from has deep knowledge of the topics they cover than whether they are employed by a news organization or have a university degree in journalism.

Most Americans agree that the people they get news from should definitely report news accurately (84%) and correct false information from public figures (64%) in their daily work. But there is less consensus around several other job functions – and relatively few say their news providers should express personal opinions about current events.

Refer to Chapter 1 for more details on what Americans want from their news providers.

Who counts as a journalist?

Most Americans (79%) agree that someone who writes for a newspaper or news website is a journalist – higher than the share who say the same about someone who reports on TV (65%), radio (59%) or any other medium.

There is less consensus about whether people who work in newer media are journalists. Fewer than half of U.S. adults say someone who hosts a news podcast (46%), writes their own newsletter about news (40%) or posts about news on social media (26%) is a journalist. In each of these cases, roughly a quarter of Americans say they aren’t sure whether these people are journalists.

This pattern aligns somewhat with how long each format has been around: Newspapers were associated with journalism for centuries before any of the more modern media existed.

Young adults are far more likely than older adults to view “new media” news providers as journalists – but are also less likely than their elders to care whether the news they get comes from people they think are journalists.



As one focus group participant in her 20s said, “I feel like anyone can do it, in a way. There’s a lot of people out there just starting their own channels taking a little bit of the importance of somebody who maybe went to school to do that …. It can make it feel like a journalist isn’t as important. Although, they are the ones that are really skilled in that job.”

Refer to Chapter 2 for a closer look at how Americans define “journalist.”

Many Americans think journalists are losing influence in society

A majority of Americans (59%) say journalists are extremely or very important to the well-being of society. An additional 31% say journalists are somewhat important, while just 9% say they are not too or not at all important.

But about half of U.S. adults (49%) say journalists are losing influence in society, compared with 15% who say they are gaining influence. And fewer than half (45%) say they have a great deal or a fair amount of confidence in journalists to act in the best interests of the public.

As one focus group participant in his 30s said, “It’s a hit or miss, I guess. There are a handful of journalists, the ones that we say we trust, that I think are doing the right thing, following what the code of journalism should be. But the others in today’s world are all about clicks, eyeballs, money, things like that, and they don’t necessarily mind tweaking the truth to suit their audience or their advertisers.”

While majorities of the public describe most journalists as intelligent (63%) and well-intentioned (58%), more than half also say most journalists are biased (58%).

Republicans and Republican-leaning independents are far less likely than Democrats and Democratic leaners to express confidence in journalists to act in the public’s best interests and to describe them in positive terms. And Republicans are much more likely than Democrats to say negative words like “elitist” and “dishonest” describe most journalists well.

Refer to Chapter 3 for more details on what Americans think about journalists.

Americans hold mixed views on journalists as community advocates

Americans are split over whether it’s acceptable for journalists to advocate for the communities they cover, but more than half agree that journalists publicly expressing their political or religious views is unacceptable when they report on an issue or event.

Those who are open to advocacy by journalists described it in focus groups as serving some communities’ needs or speaking for those who don’t have power.

But as one participant in his 30s said, “If you’re a journalist, let’s stick to journalism. And if you want to be an influencer or a social change warrior or whatever, just stick to that.”

At the same time, more than half of U.S. adults (56%) say journalists are largely unable to separate their personal views from what they report on. Republicans are much more likely than Democrats to express this view.

https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/lists/best-sports-movies-ranked/,"It’s rare that a sports movie is just a sports movie.

Through the prism of athletics, sports movies are love stories and tales of the underdog, opportunities to process war and addiction and immigration and euthanasia and economic inequality. They’re showcases for our biggest stars, our pluckiest protagonists, our most virtuoso directors, and even the occasional golden retriever allowed on the court by a rule-book loophole. They reflect our complicated past and predict our dystopian future. They speak a language understood around the globe.

Baseball is our most represented sport, landing six spots on the list. Boxing and basketball had good showings, with five and four entries, respectively. Track, tennis, hockey, cheerleading, pool, cycling and skateboarding feature in our selections, too.

https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/deftones-private-music/,"Despite how unlikely it may have seemed decades ago, when they were best known for their singer jumping on Korn’s Ice Cube cover and their own Top 40 hit about shoving things, Deftones are now among the most respected and influential bands of the 1990s. When they debuted with Adrenaline in 1995, they weren’t even the best rock band with an awkward rapper in the city of Sacramento; they were, like so many young men of their time, joined on stage and in the studio by a DJ.

Now, Hayley Williams is joining the band on stage to sing “Minerva”; we’re a full decade past the days of Deafheaven and Nothing using their tricks on black metal and shoegaze; the nation’s indie venues are lousy with bands playing drop-D punisher riffs while hoodied frontmen whisper about violent sex. Venture onto Reddit and find it clogged with people arguing about whether Deftones are nu-metal or shoegaze and the sociological implications of how you personally answer that question. Last summer, they mounted a nationwide arena tour despite their last album coming out before the Covid vaccines. The Los Angeles Times, reviewing the first of two sold-out shows in Inglewood, called them “Gen Z’s favorite heavy rock band.” The oldest members of Gen Z are two years younger than Adrenaline.

Deftones’ dramatic shift in reputation from nu-metal B-listers to avant-rock heroes has less to do with their artistic growth (considerable though it may be) than it does with the evolution of how people who like to think about rock music feel about heaviness, romance, the primacy of our emotional life, and having a body generally. You can theorize about that change if you want, but these are the conditions in which private music, the first Deftones album since 2020’s excellent Ohms, exists. Green Day and the Foo Fighters might play to bigger crowds, Korn and System of a Down might have a greater nostalgic pull. But to find another artist from the 1990s whose influence has only grown and is still making records at a high level, you probably have to start thinking about Deftones as being in a category with Radiohead (who haven’t made a record in a decade) and Björk (who, despite her continued popularity, is not doing multiple nights at the Forum). They are, against all odds, elite.

How did they get here, to arguably the height of their popularity, 25 years after the release of their best-selling album? private music—like A Moon Shaped Pool and Fossora—is unlikely to draw in unconvinced listeners, but like those records, it shows them fully in control of their instantly recognizable sound, able to effortlessly bend it around whatever structures they put in its place. Following an interlude that sounds like Tim Hecker sighing through a hurdy-gurdy, “cXz” has the kind of dreamy chorus that singer Chino Moreno can by now probably write in his literal dreams. Rather than let it soar cloudward on a thick rocket of sound, though, the band rattles into a momentum-shifting staccato led by drummer Abe Cunningham. It’s a subtle little thing, but the tension makes the song feel itchy and impatient without sacrificing its beauty. The discomfiting comfort in Deftones’ music often comes from its treatment of heaviness and prettiness—a great Deftones song can feel like an arduous hike to a stunning vista that reveals a violent storm on the horizon—but this pull in the song’s textures makes it feel like it’s urging you away from the payoff it promised to give you.","Sentiment score 0.0 , Sentiment Magnitude 7.199999809265137","name:Deftones type: 3 Salience 0.11636998504400253, name:singer type: 1 Salience 0.03799426183104515, name:shift type: 4 Salience 0.03437910974025726, name:hit type: 5 Salience 0.03340229019522667, name:music type: 5 Salience 0.02665858156979084, name:band type: 3 Salience 0.022093908861279488, name:Ice Cube type: 3 Salience 0.01979219727218151, name:rapper type: 1 Salience 0.016074959188699722, name:city type: 2 Salience 0.016074959188699722, name:men type: 1 Salience 0.016074959188699722, name:artist type: 1 Salience 0.014839818701148033, name:Korn type: 1 Salience 0.01202956959605217, name:Adrenaline type: 1 Salience 0.010825205594301224, name:Sacramento type: 2 Salience 0.009509745985269547, name:Björk type: 1 Salience 0.008886625058948994, name:people type: 1 Salience 0.0079164644703269, name:interlude type: 5 Salience 0.0071597048081457615, name:Abe Cunningham type: 1 Salience 0.006294408813118935, name:song type: 5 Salience 0.006245767697691917, name:studio type: 2 Salience 0.00608848687261343","Category:/Arts & Entertainment/Music & Audio/Rock Music , Category_confidence:98.0%"

The profound human experience of learning — whether inside a classroom or in a less conventional environment — is a rich topic for the big screen. So if you’re struggling to find your school spirit as the minutes tick away on the countdown to the first day, there’s a stream that can help you feel excited to hit the books once again.

Try cueing up one of these family-friendly movie picks, including musicals, comedies, dramas, and animated films. These stories celebrate the good (kind teachers, great friends, and unforgettable experiences) as well as the bad (dismissive adults, cruel bullies, and difficult lessons). Check out the picks below for back-to-school movies for all ages, and remember to stay curious!

Roald Dahl's Matilda The Musical

Here’s a movie with a storied pedigree: Roald Dahl’s classic 1988 children’s novel inspired Danny DeVito’s beloved 1996 film, then became a musical in 2011 with music and lyrics by Tim Minchin and book by Dennis Kelly (winning seven Olivier Awards and five Tonys). Now, the stage show has its own screen adaptation with Matthew Warchus’s fantastical 2022 musical movie. Alisha Weir stars in the title role as a neglected young girl with extraordinary abilities who starts at a new school, where she runs afoul of the villainous headmistress Miss Trunchbull (Emma Thompson) but finds an ally in her teacher Miss Honey (Lashana Lynch).

Leo

Take in the classroom from an underrepresented point of view: inside the tank of the class pet. Adam Sandler is the voice of Leo the lizard, who watches a fifth-grade class from the terrarium he shares with Squirtle the turtle (voiced by Bill Burr), in this 2023 animated musical comedy by Robert Marianetti, Robert Smigel, and David Wachtenheim. Over an eventful year, the wise old reptile involves himself in the dramas of his class by revealing his secret ability to speak and offering advice whenever someone takes him home, all the while dreaming of making his escape to the Everglades.

The Boy Who Harnessed the Wind

Chiwetel Ejiofor made his directorial debut with this uplifting drama, which is based on William Kamkwamba’s memoir written with journalist Bryan Mealer, and had its premiere at Sundance in 2019. The acclaimed film takes place in Malawi in the early 2000s, when Kamkwamba (Maxwell Simba) was a young boy with an interest in science and a burgeoning talent for engineering. With his village on the brink of famine due to a relentless drought killing their crops, young William sets out to build a windmill that can power a broken water pump, even as his father (Ejiofor) expresses skepticism about the endeavor.

Captain Underpants: The First Epic Movie

Hold on to your underpants, because you’re in for an epic ride. Based on Dav Pilkey’s book series, David Soren’s 2017 animated comedy tells its titular hero’s irreverent origin story. When two best friends (voiced by Kevin Hart and Thomas Middleditch) get caught playing a prank, their dour principal, Mr. Krupp (Ed Helms), threatens to separate them into different fourth-grade classes. To stay together, the boys hypnotize Mr. Krupp, turning him into a superhero of their own invention: Captain Underpants. When Professor Pee-Pee Diarrheastein Poopypants Esquire launches a sinister plot, there’s only one hero who can stop him.

The Karate Kid

With Pat Morita’s Mr. Miyagi, The Karate Kid introduced one of the most beloved teachers in pop culture history. John G. Avildsen’s 1984 coming-of-age classic stars Ralph Macchio as Daniel, a new kid in town who gets targeted by defending karate champ and bully Johnny (William Zabka). After learning karate from Mr. Miyagi — whose wisdom applies to life (and cars) as much as martial arts — Daniel finds the courage to face his fears. There’s no need to stop after the first lesson, either: Follow up the original with its 1986 and 1989 sequels, Harald Zwart’s 2010 remake starring Jaden Smith and Jackie Chan, and six seasons of the 2018 sequel series Cobra Kai, in which Macchio and Zabka reprise their roles, this time as adults.

My Octopus Teacher

Winner of the Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature, Pippa Ehrlich and James Reed’s 2020 film is a moving reminder that great teachers come in all shapes — sometimes eight-tentacled shapes, even — and sizes. The doc follows filmmaker and naturalist Craig Foster as he starts free-diving off the coast of South Africa, filming what he sees, including a friendly young octopus. What he never expected to discover, though, was a powerful connection with the animal, which builds over time as she shows Foster her world, teaching him about her life underwater. It’s a film with roots in science and a reach far beyond the classroom, revealing how life lessons and true friendship can be found in the most unexpected places.","Sentiment score 0.30000001192092896 , Sentiment Magnitude 13.699999809265137","name:school type: 3 Salience 0.028531165793538094, name:teachers type: 1 Salience 0.02754698507487774, name:pencils type: 6 Salience 0.024687111377716064, name:Mr. type: 1 Salience 0.021088633686304092, name:William Zabka type: 1 Salience 0.017244013026356697, name:girl type: 1 Salience 0.01710822433233261, name:classroom type: 2 Salience 0.016557345166802406, name:films type: 5 Salience 0.01515213306993246, name:books type: 5 Salience 0.012718306854367256, name:comedies type: 5 Salience 0.0126734534278512, name:dramas type: 5 Salience 0.0126734534278512, name:friends type: 1 Salience 0.012638771906495094, name:Chiwetel Ejiofor type: 1 Salience 0.012439331039786339, name:Daniel type: 1 Salience 0.012173776514828205, name:stories type: 5 Salience 0.01152939721941948, name:stage show type: 5 Salience 0.011397275142371655, name:Craig Foster type: 1 Salience 0.010227170772850513, name:Adam Sandler type: 1 Salience 0.00935105700045824, name:musicals type: 5 Salience 0.009073378518223763, name:Krupp type: 1 Salience 0.008908751420676708","Category:/Arts & Entertainment/Movies , Category_confidence:88.0%"

It's Friday, and in approximately one week the doors will slam shut on eligibility for the 68th annual Grammy Awards. For some (read: our host), this penultimate week proved to be a strategic scramble. With big names like Earl Sweatshirt, Ghostface Killah, Kid Cudi, Laufey and even the prodigal Deftones establishing themselves as Grammy hopefuls, there was no way we could dig into everything in our New Music Friday podcast.

But we did highlight five albums — you could call them the nominees for Album Of The Week. Stephen Thompson and Tad Cautious from Vermont Public dove into new records that look beyond the Grammy frenzy, before discussing those big names that tend to dominate the internet in an extended Lightning Round.

Sponsor Message

The duo talk through Baltimore auteur Nourished By Time's newest album, The Passionate Ones — a soulful lesson in disillusionment and hope, stitched together with some dance grooves. We also get into Mac Demarco's most intimate and modest project yet, Guitar, and Kathleen Edwards' Billionaire, which was co-produced by Americana luminary Jason Isbell.

Listen to Stephen and Tad discuss those three albums and more on the Aug. 22 edition of New Music Friday, wherever you get your podcasts.

https://www.pewresearch.org/race-and-ethnicity/2025/08/21/u-s-unauthorized-immigrant-population-reached-a-record-14-million-in-2023/,"In the years after the COVID-19 pandemic, U.S. immigration policy changes fueled a sharp rise in both legal and illegal immigration. Lawful admissions jumped, as did encounters at the U.S.-Mexico border between migrants and U.S. authorities.

The number of unauthorized immigrants in the United States reached an all-time high of 14 million in 2023 after two consecutive years of record growth, according to a new Pew Research Center estimate. The increase of 3.5 million in two years is the biggest on record. Data from 2023 is the most recent available for developing a comprehensive and detailed estimate.

The label “unauthorized immigrants” captures a complex array of statuses, including immigrants who entered the U.S. legally. While the label is not perfect, it groups together immigrants living in the country with impermanent, precarious statuses. The term has been used for decades by researchers who develop estimates of the population and is generally used in this report.

The increase from 2021 to 2023 was driven primarily by growth in the number of unauthorized immigrants who were living in the U.S. with some protections from deportation, such as immigrants paroled into the country and asylum seekers. About 6 million immigrants without full legal status had some protection from deportation in 2023, up from 2.7 million in 2021. In 2007, when the total unauthorized immigrant population was at its previous high (12.2 million), about 500,000 had some protection from deportation.

The total number with temporary protections from deportations increased after 2021 following policy changes made by the Biden administration that allowed many immigrants to arrive in the U.S. with protected status and others to gain protection shortly after arriving.

Unauthorized immigrants with some protection from deportation accounted for more than 40% of those without full legal status in 2023. These protections can be, and in some cases have been, removed by the federal government, sometimes with little notification.

To understand which groups are considered unauthorized immigrants in this analysis, read “Who are unauthorized immigrants?” later in this report.

In 2023, unauthorized immigrants accounted for 27% of all U.S. immigrants, up from 22% in 2021. The group’s share of the U.S. population increased from 3.1% to 4.1% during this time.

Changes to the unauthorized immigrant population, 2024-25

Through early 2024, the overall unauthorized immigrant population continued to grow at a record pace, according to a Center review of preliminary and incomplete data sources. After mid-2024, policy decisions spanning the Biden and Trump administrations again changed this population. Growth slowed considerably in the last half of 2024 after the Biden administration stopped accepting asylum applications at the border and paused parole programs.

In 2025, the unauthorized immigrant population has probably started to decline, due in part to increased deportations and reduced protections under the Trump administration.

As of mid-2025, the unauthorized immigrant population likely remains above 2023 levels. Still, we won’t know the full impact of these policy shifts until more complete data becomes available.

Learn more about how the unauthorized immigrant population may have changed in 2024-25, according to preliminary, incomplete data.

Overview of this report

This report explores the dynamics shaping the population of immigrants living in the U.S. without full lawful status. It provides a complete estimate and profile for the unauthorized immigrant population in 2023 based on the best data currently available. The report also provides a look at how the population has since changed, sketching out trends based on incomplete data from 2024 and the first half of 2025 – though complete estimates are not yet possible due to these limitations.

The new estimates for 2023 (and revised estimates for 2022) are based on Pew Research Center analysis of Census Bureau data from the American Community Survey (ACS), the most recent data available for a fully detailed estimate of unauthorized immigration. The survey data for these two years has been supplemented to take into account recent Census Bureau revisions of their data on the magnitude of immigration to the U.S.

Read “How we did this” for more.

Which groups of U.S. unauthorized immigrants had deportation protection in 2023?

Several groups of unauthorized immigrants had some protections from deportation in July 2023:

Asylum applicants (2.6 million)

Those who entered the U.S. legally after receiving parole (700,000)

Victims of crimes or violence (700,000)

Those with Temporary Protected Status (TPS), which is available to migrants in the U.S. from countries facing war, natural disasters or other crises (650,000)

Enrollees in Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA), which is available to those who were brought to the U.S. illegally as children (600,000)

Another 1.0 million migrants encountered by U.S. Border Patrol were released into the U.S., typically with orders to appear in immigration court. These immigrants have some protections from deportation while their cases are resolved, but their protections are more limited.

Individuals in these groups are counted as part of the “unauthorized” immigrant population because their deportation protections are temporary and can quickly change. For example, the Trump administration in 2025 has:

Removed deportation protections and rescinded work permits for about 500,000 parolees from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua and Venezuela.

Allowed protections to expire for about 350,000 Venezuelans and 350,000 Haitians with TPS.

Stopped accepting asylum applications from immigrants who enter the country at the U.S.-Mexico border, a move that has been challenged in court.

Largely stopped releasing immigrants into the U.S. who are encountered at the border.

The vast majority of unauthorized immigrants – more than 12 million in 2023 – either entered the U.S. illegally or overstayed a visa. Another 2 million entered the U.S. legally and were paroled or released into the country. Protection from deportation provided by programs such as DACA, TPS or asylum are only available to immigrants already in the U.S.

What is the composition of the U.S. immigrant population?

As of 2023, unauthorized immigrants represented 4.1% of the total U.S. population and 27% of the foreign-born population.

Meanwhile, the lawful immigrant population grew steadily from 24.1 million in 2000 to 37.8 million in 2023. The growth was driven by a rapid increase in the number of naturalized citizens, from 10.7 million to 23.8 million. The number of lawful permanent residents largely held steady at 11.9 million. As a result, in 2023, almost half (46%) of all immigrants in the country were naturalized U.S. citizens.

U.S. immigrant population trends

The overall U.S. immigrant population reached an all-time high of more than 53 million in January 2025, accounting for a record 15.8% of the U.S. population. However, growth slowed substantially starting in early 2024, and the number declined by more than 1 million between January and June 2025, according to data from the Current Population Survey. This would be the first sustained drop in the U.S. immigrant population since the 1960s.

What countries do unauthorized immigrants come from?

The number of U.S. unauthorized immigrants born in countries other than Mexico grew from 6.4 million in 2021 to 9.7 million in 2023.

By contrast, the unauthorized immigrant population born in Mexico grew only a little from 2021 to 2023, returning to its 2019 level of about 4.3 million.

Though Mexico remains the country where the most unauthorized immigrants in the U.S. are from, it accounted for 30% of the nation’s unauthorized immigrants living here in 2023. Mexicans represented a majority of unauthorized immigrants in the U.S. through 2016; their share in 2023 was by far the smallest share on record.

After Mexico, the countries with the largest unauthorized immigrant populations in the U.S. in 2023 were:

Guatemala (850,000)

El Salvador (850,000)

Honduras (775,000)

India (680,000)

In 2023, Venezuela was the country of birth for 650,000 U.S. unauthorized immigrants. This population has seen particularly fast growth, from 55,000 in 2007 to 195,000 in 2021 and 650,000 in 2023.

Other countries have also had large increases in the number of unauthorized immigrants in recent years. Totals from Venezuela, Cuba, Colombia, Nicaragua, Ecuador, Ukraine and Peru all more than doubled from 2021 to 2023.

The number of unauthorized immigrants from Cuba grew from less than 5,000 in 2019 to 100,000 in 2021 and 475,000 in 2023. This increase came after Cubans could no longer enter the U.S. legally without a visa, a change in policy made in 2017 under the Obama administration. Much of the recent growth in unauthorized immigrant populations from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua, Venezuela and Ukraine was due to parole programs instituted under President Joe Biden and that were ended by mid-2025.

El Salvador, India, China and the Philippines are the only countries to show no significant change in their U.S. unauthorized immigrant populations between 2021 and 2023 (among countries with more than 150,000 unauthorized immigrants).

World regions

The number of unauthorized immigrants from almost every world region increased since 2021. The largest increases were from South America (1.3 million), Central America (725,000) and the Caribbean (575,000).

What states do unauthorized immigrants live in?

The six states with the largest unauthorized immigrant populations in 2023 were:

California (2.3 million)

Texas (2.1 million)

Florida (1.6 million)

New York (825,000)

New Jersey (600,000)

Illinois (550,000)

These states have consistently had the most unauthorized immigrants since at least 1980. However, in 2007, California had 1.2 million more unauthorized immigrants than Texas. Today, it has only about 200,000 more.

The U.S. unauthorized immigrant population has also become considerably less geographically concentrated over time. In 2023, the top six states were home to 56% of the nation’s unauthorized immigrants, down from 80% in 1990.

States where the unauthorized immigrant population grew the most

The unauthorized immigrant populations grew in 32 states from 2021 to 2023. The four states with the biggest growth were:

Florida (+700,000)

Texas (+450,000)

California (+425,000)

New York (+230,000)

Eight additional states had their unauthorized immigrant populations increase by 75,000 or more: New Jersey, Illinois, Georgia, North Carolina, Massachusetts, Pennsylvania, Maryland and Ohio.

Oregon is the only state with a population of more than 100,000 unauthorized immigrants where this group did not increase compared with 2021.

Even with these increases in recent years, six states had smaller unauthorized immigrant populations in 2023 than in 2007, the previous peak – Arizona, California, Nevada, New Mexico, New York and Oregon.

How many households include unauthorized immigrants?

A record 7.5 million U.S. households included unauthorized immigrants in 2023. They represented 5.6% of 133 million households nationwide. Overall, a total of 26 million people – including about 14 million unauthorized immigrants – lived in these households.

In 88% of these households, either the householder or their spouse was an unauthorized immigrant.

Almost 70% of these households are considered “mixed status,” meaning that they also contained U.S.-born residents or lawful immigrants. Most of the U.S.-born residents are children of unauthorized immigrants.

The share of households that include an unauthorized immigrant varies considerably across states. Nevada (10%) had the highest share in 2023, followed by California, Texas, Florida and New Jersey (9% each). In Montana, West Virginia and Vermont, about 1% of households included an unauthorized immigrant.

How many children in the U.S. have unauthorized immigrant parents?

About 4.6 million children under 18 born in the U.S. lived with an unauthorized immigrant parent in 2023, up from 4.0 million in 2021 and below the previous high of 4.9 million in 2016. As of 2023, these children accounted for about 75% of all minor children living with an unauthorized immigrant parent.

(In 2023, about 300,000 babies were born in the U.S. to an unauthorized immigrant, up from about 200,000 in 2021.)

In addition, about 1.5 million children under 18 were unauthorized immigrants in 2023. This group nearly doubled since 2021, and much of the rapid growth in the overall unauthorized immigrant population was due to families arriving in the U.S. with their foreign-born children. The 2023 total matches the previous high in 2005.

Another 1.4 million adults born in the U.S. lived with at least one parent who is an unauthorized immigrant in 2023, compared with 1.2 million in 2021 and only about 200,000 in 2005.

How long have unauthorized immigrants lived in the U.S.?

A record number of unauthorized immigrants have been in the U.S. for a relatively short time due to the rapid growth in the overall unauthorized population since 2021. In 2023, more than 4.2 million unauthorized immigrant adults had been in the U.S. for less than five years, up from 1.8 million in 2021. The 2023 figure is more than double the number in any year from 2010 to 2019.

A similar number of unauthorized immigrant adults – 4.3 million – had lived in the U.S. for 18 years or more in 2023. This is up slightly from 2021, when the total was 4.1 million.

Another 3.8 million unauthorized immigrant adults had lived in the U.S. for 5 to 17 years in 2023, roughly the same as in 2021.

How many unauthorized immigrants are in the labor force?

The number of unauthorized immigrants in the U.S. workforce grew from 7.8 million in 2021 to a record 9.7 million in 2023.

Unauthorized immigrants represented 5.6% of the U.S. workforce in 2023, a new high. The previous peak was 5.4% in 2007.

Since 2003, unauthorized immigrants have made up 4.4% to 5.6% of all U.S. workers, a relatively narrow range.

The share of the U.S. workforce made up of unauthorized immigrants is higher than their 4.1% share of the total U.S. population. That’s because the unauthorized immigrant population includes relatively few children or elderly adults, groups that tend not to be in the labor force.

Detailed table: Unauthorized immigrants in the labor force for states, 2023 (Excel)

The share of unauthorized immigrants in the workforce varied across states in 2023. Nevada (9%), Florida (9%), New Jersey (9%), Texas (9%), California (8%), Maryland (7%) and Massachusetts (7%) had the highest shares, while 1% or less of workers in Maine, Vermont, West Virginia and Montana were unauthorized immigrants.

What types of jobs do unauthorized immigrants have?

Unauthorized immigrants work in essentially every sector of the economy. The industries with the highest shares of unauthorized immigrants in their workforce in 2023 were construction (15%), agriculture (14%), leisure and hospitality (8%), other services (7%), and professional/business services (7%).

The major occupations with the highest shares of unauthorized immigrants were farming (24%), construction (19%) and service occupations (9%). There are no occupations where unauthorized immigrants represent a majority of workers. But in some detailed occupations, unauthorized immigrants represented 25% to about 40% of all workers in 2023. Most of these jobs are in the construction sector.

Note: The remaining two sections of this report provide a look ahead to what has happened since 2023, as well as additional context and details about the primary analysis above.

What has happened to the unauthorized immigrant population since 2023?

The nation’s unauthorized immigrant population is dynamic. The estimate of 14 million unauthorized immigrants in the United States as of July 2023 is based on the U.S. Census Bureau’s 2023 American Community Survey (ACS), the most recent version available. Since 2023, the population has continued to change. But surveys and other federal government data sources only give us a rough idea of what has happened to the unauthorized immigrant population in 2024 and 2025. Still, these sources do hint at some changes since July 2023.

Administrative data from the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) provides counts through November 2024 of entries of certain migrants that are considered part of the unauthorized immigrant population, specifically releases at the border and the entry of some parolees. DHS also has data on admission of lawful immigrants (LPRs) through December 2024. These two sources can track changes in the lawful foreign-born population and a large part of the unauthorized immigrant population.

The Census Bureau’s monthly Current Population Survey (CPS), used to measure unemployment, provides information on the size of the immigrant population. However, its sample is not large enough and the survey does not have the data needed to develop an estimate of the unauthorized immigrant population that is comparable to the ACS-based estimates. Still, a consistent series of monthly CPS data is available for July 2023 to December 2024 to track changes in the immigrant population. Similarly, the monthly CPS is also available for January 2025 through June 2025. But because of some methodological changes in the survey, the 2025 estimates cannot be compared directly with the 2024 estimates.

The U.S. unauthorized immigrant population likely continued to increase rapidly through at least mid-2024, reaching new highs, according to available government data. Growth continued in the second half of 2024 at a much slower pace and may have stopped entirely as inflows dropped dramatically due to Biden administration policy changes (described below).

From January to June 2025, the unauthorized immigrant population likely declined, possibly by as much as 1 million. However, as of July 2025, the unauthorized immigrant population almost surely remains higher than in July 2023, when we estimated that the population stood at 14 million. As more data is released, more precise estimates for 2024 and 2025 will be possible.

The sections below provide the details behind these conclusions.

Immigrant inflows, 2023-24

From July 2023 through June 2024, more than 2.1 million immigrants were released or paroled into the U.S. These groups are considered a part of the unauthorized immigrant population. The largest group, U.S. Border Patrol releases, accounted for more than 1.1 million new arrivals of unauthorized immigrants. Another 1 million were paroled into the U.S. at the southwestern border and through the CHNV (Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua, Venezuela) and U4U (Uniting for Ukraine) parole programs. (Read “Who are unauthorized immigrants?” for more on these groups and programs.)

When making a new estimate of the unauthorized immigrant population, we cannot simply add these new immigrants to the previous estimate. However, the large inflows imply continued, rapid growth past our 14 million estimate for mid-2023.

After July 2024, there was a dramatic slowdown in these measured inflows. About 400,000 migrants were released or paroled into the U.S. from July to December 2024, a reduction of more than 60% in average monthly entries from the previous year. The main reduction came from a change in practice by the Border Patrol, which released many fewer migrants into the U.S., about 60,000, during these six months, compared with more than 1.1 million during the preceding 12 months. In addition, the Biden administration stopped admitting migrants under the CHNV parole program in August 2024. Only about 35,000 were admitted after July 2024, which was about 10% of the total from the previous 12 months. By November 2024, there were no CHNV paroles.

Data on admissions of these groups is not currently available for 2025.

The Census Bureau estimated total net immigration for July 2023-June 2024 at 2.8 million, based in part on the releases and paroles just noted. This figure represents a notable increase over the migration estimates for 2021-22 (1.7 million) and 2022-23 (2.3 million). Since legal immigration did not increase markedly over recent years, the large estimated inflow for 2023-24 was almost entirely attributable to unauthorized immigration, continuing the trend seen in our estimates of this population for 2021-23.

Foreign-born population, 2023-24

The U.S. foreign-born population grew from 48.5 million in July 2023 to 51.6 million in March 2024, according to the monthly CPS – an unprecedented increase of 3 million immigrants in nine months. Much of this growth was driven by the admission of unauthorized immigrants with temporary deportation protections. The monthly data paired with the inflow estimates noted earlier imply rapid growth in the unauthorized immigrant population at least through March 2024.

After this increase, the foreign-born population hardly changed in the last nine months of 2024. By December 2024, the foreign-born population of 51.8 million was only 125,000 larger than in March 2024. The slowdown in growth is consistent with the large drop in arrivals (inflows) during the second half of the year. This pattern suggests that the unauthorized immigrant population grew very little by the end of 2024 after the large increase through the first part of the year, and it may even have declined very slightly from an earlier peak in 2024.

Foreign-born population, 2025

Although monthly CPS data is available for 2025, it cannot be used to measure change in the foreign-born population from 2024 into 2025 because the Census Bureau revised its method for estimating the U.S. population. However, the CPS can be used to track the size of the immigrant population from month to month in 2025 and going forward.

In January 2025, the CPS measured the foreign-born population at 53.3 million, or 15.8 percent of the U.S. population – both all-time highs. Since then, the CPS data shows a decline during the first six months of 2025, especially after March. By June 2025, the foreign-born population was 51.9 million, a drop of about 1.5 million from the peak in January.

The CPS does not tell us the sources of the decline, but most of the drop is likely due to a fall in the unauthorized immigrant population. The federal government has started to increase deportations, and some immigrants – both unauthorized and lawful – have left the U.S. on their own. It is also possible that some of the population decline is due to technical reasons such as a decrease in response rates to the survey.

Who are unauthorized immigrants?

The U.S. unauthorized immigrant population includes any immigrants not in the following groups:

Lawful permanent residents (green card holders) Refugees formally admitted to the United States People granted asylum Former unauthorized immigrants granted legal residence under the 1986 Immigration Reform and Control Act Naturalized U.S. citizens who entered under categories 1-4 (above) Temporary legal residents under specific visa categories, such as those for foreign students, guest workers and intracompany transfers.

Read Methodology A: Unauthorized immigrant estimates for more details.

Many immigrants included in Pew Research Center’s estimate of “unauthorized” immigrants have specific immigration statuses that protect them from deportation. In some cases, as described below, unauthorized immigrants have received permission to live or work in the U.S. As of July 2023, about 6 million immigrants had protections. They are included in the Center’s estimate of 14 million unauthorized immigrants. These protected immigrants account for about 40% of our 2023 national estimate.

Although these immigrants may be protected from deportation, their status could change if immigration policy shifts. Other organizations and the federal government also include these immigrants in their estimates of the U.S. unauthorized immigrant population.

Types of temporary permissions

Unauthorized immigrants can receive temporary permission to be in the U.S. in the following ways:

Asylum applicants

Individuals who have applied for asylum and are awaiting a ruling are not legal residents but cannot be deported until their asylum claim is adjudicated. There are two kinds of asylum claims:

Defensive asylum: Applications are filed by individuals facing deportation or removal from the U.S. These are processed by the Justice Department’s Executive Office for Immigration Review (EOIR). An estimated 1.3 million immigrants had pending defensive asylum applications as of July 2023.

Applications are filed by individuals facing deportation or removal from the U.S. These are processed by the Justice Department’s Executive Office for Immigration Review (EOIR). An estimated 1.3 million immigrants had pending defensive asylum applications as of July 2023. Affirmative asylum: Applications are filed by people not in deportation proceedings. These are processed by the Department of Homeland Security’s U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS). An estimated 1.2 million individuals were awaiting decisions on more than 900,000 applications as of mid-2023.

Temporary Protected Status (TPS)

About 650,000 unauthorized immigrants had TPS in July 2023. This status provides protection from deportation to individuals who cannot safely return to their country because of civil unrest, violence or natural disaster. Most also have permission to work in the U.S. Some recipients from El Salvador, Honduras and Nicaragua have had TPS for over 20 years. If conditions in the home country improve, TPS can be allowed to expire or revoked.

Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA)

DACA offers protection from deportation and work permits to individuals who were brought to the U.S. as children before 2007. As of July 2023, there were an estimated 610,000 active DACA beneficiaries, mostly from Mexico. By March 2025, this had dropped to 525,000.

Humanitarian parole into the U.S.

Immigrants outside the United States who are not otherwise eligible for admission can apply for admission to the U.S. on a temporary basis “for urgent humanitarian reasons of significant public benefit.” Parolees undergo a clearance process, generally have sponsors and can apply for work authorization. Parole is for a set period of time and can be revoked.

President Joe Biden authorized four parole programs that significantly increased the number of immigrants coming to the U.S. after 2021, adding to the unauthorized immigrant population:

Operation Allies Welcome (OAW): This parole program for Afghan nationals who could not get other kinds of visas to enter the U.S. started on Aug. 29, 2021, after the U.S. evacuation from Afghanistan. In total, about 88,500 Afghan nationals were admitted and received work authorization under the OAW program between July 31, 2021, and Sept. 30, 2023. Some have since applied for asylum and some for TPS. Their status had been renewed, though the Trump administration has proposed ending the program.

Uniting for Ukraine (U4U): This program started in April 2022 to allow Ukrainians fleeing the Russian invasion to come to the U.S. on a temporary basis. By mid-2023, about 130,000 Ukrainians had been paroled into the U.S. under U4U, a total that grew to 240,000 by the end of 2024.

Parole processes for Cubans, Haitians, Nicaraguans and Venezuelans (CHNV): This program allowed individuals from these four countries to apply for admission while outside the U.S. because of conditions in their home country. Before being accepted, applicants needed to have a U.S.-based sponsor, pass a background check and pay for travel to the U.S. They were then allowed to enter the U.S. for two years; these paroles could be extended. Admissions began for Venezuelans in October 2022 with the other three nations added in January 2023. The program admitted up to 30,000 migrants each month.

By July 2023, about 160,000 immigrants had come to the U.S. under CHNV parole. The Biden administration stopped accepting new applications in August 2024, and by November 2024 no new CHNV parolees were admitted. All told, about 530,000 migrants came with CHNV parole. The Supreme Court upheld the Trump administration’s decision to revoke CHNV’s deportation protection in May 2025.

Office of Field Operations (OFO) paroles: In late 2020, U.S. Border Control (USBP) saw a major rise in migrant encounters, with the number more than doubling to greater than 70,000 per month; by mid-2021, they had tripled to about 210,000 per month. To ease pressure on border facilities, the Border Patrol, through the OFO, began paroling immigrants into the United States. Humanitarian paroles by OFO averaged less than 2,000 per month from January 2017 through March 2022. Numbers jumped to more than 20,000 through early 2023 and to about 45,000 per month through the end of 2024. The computer app CBP One, activated by USBP in January 2023, enabled migrants to make appointments in advance.

Individuals paroled into the U.S. by OFO have temporary protection from deportation for two years and can apply for work authorization, asylum and other immigration statuses. By mid-2023, about 340,000 immigrants had temporary protection from deportation through OFO paroles; by the end of 2024, this number almost tripled to 980,000.

Releases by U.S. Border Partrol

In response to the growing number of border encounters, USBP increased the total number of expulsions and repatriations, but this did not relieve pressures at the southwest border. While USBP had always released some of the migrants it encountered into the U.S., these numbers increased markedly from 2021 to 2023. Starting in mid-2021, releases averaged about 50,000 per month for the next year, and fell to 15,000 in February 2023. Releases then peaked at more than 190,000 in December 2023 and remained historically high until July 2024. For the remainder of 2024, releases dropped to an average of about 10,000 per month.

These individuals do not have the same level of protection from deportation as migrants paroled into the U.S. They are generally instructed to appear before an immigration judge or report to immigration authorities at a later date. They have a year to apply for asylum or other types of temporary protection. The Biden administration generally did not attempt to deport these individuals so, for our estimates, we assume that individuals released into the U.S. are protected from deportation for slightly more than a year. As of mid-2023, there were about 1 million immigrants in this group.

Victims of crime, human trafficking and abuse

U.S. immigration law includes protections for people who have experienced trafficking, abuse or violence. These individuals can stay temporarily in the U.S. with protection from deportation and often later apply for a green card. They are counted in our unauthorized immigrant population if they have not yet received lawful permanent resident status.

Summary

There are about 6 million unauthorized immigrants with some degree of protection as of July 2023. The groups with temporary protection from deportation described above total just over 6.2 million individuals. However, some individuals can appear in more than one category. For example, some paroled into the U.S. (say, OAW Afghans) may also acquire another status like TPS. While exact overlap is not known, most newly arrived groups likely do not appear in multiple categories. We estimate about 250,000 migrants are counted more than once. This leaves a total of about 6 million unauthorized immigrants with some degree of protection from deportation.

https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/music/story/2025-08-22/deftones-private-music-chino-moreno-new-album,"Nearly 40 years into Deftones’ career, the Sacramento-bred band are anything but a legacy act. As proved by the visceral allegiance from countless fans half their age thrashing at their feet as they perform on stage, the band continues to be as explosive as they were when they conquered the Warped Tour in the late ‘90s.

The band’s late-era surge in popularity with generations of fans who missed their first (and second) go-round inspires and surprises them.

“It does freak me out when I sit back and, in retrospect, think about it,” Chino Moreno says of Deftones’ longevity. Sitting backstage in a Victoria, Canada, arena during a break from the band’s pre-tour rehearsal, kicking off in Vancouver on Friday, Moreno, 52, is relaxed as he discusses their place in the hard rock landscape.

Since roughly 2022, the singer has noticed that the crowds at some of the band’s meet and greets were younger. In some cases, fans in their teens and early 20s were introducing their parents to the band’s catalog, including their turn-of-the-century classic, “White Pony.”

That stature has only grown as elements of Deftones’ amorphously aggressive sound, which has elements of post-hardcore, trip hop and, most relevant to their revival, shoegaze, have attracted a much younger audience. They’ve broken out from being a cult and critical favorite from the nü-metal scene to being widely appreciated as one of the most important and influential bands of that era.

“I’m not a big social media person,” Moreno says of the medium that’s enabled a new generation to discover Deftones. “There are positive sides to it, like amongst all the noise, you can share music. It is neat that everybody’s much more connected to be able to share it like that.”

Yet, he’s aware that based on the online resurgence, Deftones don’t have to release a new album. Even so, seeing this influx of a younger fan base invigorated the band. It has driven the band to push themselves not just on stage, but in the studio.

“Having this whole new generation of eyes on us and more attention now than we’ve had in decades. So why not embrace it?” he says. “I love that I met a lot of parents and children, fathers and daughters, and they’re at the show together as a bonding experience, and to talk about some type of art you both connected over … it’s really cool.”

The band also knew that if they were going to write and record, it had to be for the right reasons.

Recording “can’t be where the label needs [the album], or we need money,” Moreno explains. “We’ve made records under those circumstances before, and it sucks the fun out of the experience. We’re bratty in that way where we only want to do something if it’s something we want to do. The minute someone tells us we have to do it, then we fight it.”

With the band’s members now scattered across the U.S., Deftones couldn’t wait to get back into the studio together, just like they did as teens when they had a space that felt more like a clubhouse. As Moreno puts it, it excited them to be able to “experiment and hang out together. Locking ourselves in a room for six hours a day, five days a week, was fun. It was like going back into the clubhouse again.”

With “Private Music,” Deftones once again joined forces with Nick Raskulinecz, who produced “Diamond Eyes” and 2012’s “Koi No Yokan” (“Dude, we have to finish the trifecta!” Moreno says he told Raskulinecz whenever they’d see each other.) Throughout the last year and a half, the band and Raskulinecz worked together through a variety of sessions before deciding on the 11 songs that constitute the album. Without a definitive timetable to release their 10th studio album, it allowed for a much more relaxed and enjoyable atmosphere than before. That said, the time between 2020’s “Ohms” and “Private Music” was the longest span between Deftones albums.

“We’re in a mind frame where it’s like we don’t have to make a record,” he says. “It gave us a kick in the butt. If people are talking about us holding us to a certain standard and pushing ourselves. So the fact that we’re gonna do it, we might as well make it great.”

A band this far into its career is generally in their victory-lap era. Write, record, release an album, go on tour, play mostly the hits, sprinkle in a new song, repeat. Not Deftones. Throughout this album, which is another significant achievement, the band mixes the moody and melodic to create a genre-bending album full of fire and fury. Look no further than the equally bombastic “My Mind Is a Mountain” and “Locked Club,” the menacing “Ecdysis,” the soaring Moreno-powered “I Think About You All the Time,” and the push-and-pull of the methodical “cxz.” Throughout the sessions, which included three additional songs left in various states, Deftones wrote and recorded batches of songs in different locations, which Moreno says allowed for a respective track to have its own sonic personality as a product of its environment.

“‘I Think About You All the Time’ was written in Malibu at 8 in the morning and was pretty fast,” he says. “We put it aside then, after dinner that night, we made some coffee and went out and finished it. Whereas with ‘Ecdysis,’ it was the last song we wrote, and it was while we were in the studio. We were looking at our collection of songs that we already had and just going, like, ‘OK, where does it fit within this batch of songs?’ We wanted something jagged and also a little weird that was more experimental but with an aggressive approach.”

As their tours have gotten bigger, external factors have given the band a new appreciation for their ongoing success. During the band’s 2024 Coachella appearance, guitarist Stephen Carpenter felt his performance wasn’t up to his standard, telling Zane Lowe of Apple Radio that he was “completely out of it for both shows. I barely had enough energy to stand up. All I could think about during those shows was, ‘Please, just don’t fall over on stage.’” Later, he’d find out that he has Type II diabetes.

A few years before Carpenter learned of his health issues, Moreno got sober. Those changes enabled the bandmates, friends since they were teens, to become even closer, despite any misconceived notion that they’ve been at odds. Though Carpenter doesn’t travel internationally with Deftones due to his condition, when the band was on the road in the States earlier this year, he and Moreno were busmates. They pushed each other to remain on their respective lifestyle-changing tracks.

“I think we’re both very proud of each other,” Moreno says of their changes. “He is so on it. He’s an obsessive person about a lot of things, and now he’s obsessed about his blood sugar and about his health. It’s parallel to my sobriety. So we get on the bus after a show, and we’re all into our diet. With my sobriety, I think he sees me being a better version of myself.”

“Private Music” stands not just as a wonderfully cohesive riff-heavy body of work with a relentless energy that is the next shapeshifting step in the Deftones catalog, but is also a well-balanced album. It’s a logical sonic step for the Deftones universe. The band has also been building its annual Dia de Los Deftones festival. The lineup for the sixth edition, taking place in November in San Diego, includes Virginia Beach, Va., hip-hop heroes Clipse, beloved metal band Deafheaven, Rico Nasty, 2hollis and more. Comparing curating the festival to compiling a mixtape, Deftones is the common thread that ties these diverse artists together, which Moreno calls “a fun experiment.”

Decades later, it’s Deftones’ music and adventurous sonic spirit that keep the crowds coming back, anticipating the group’s next move. It’s allowed them to gradually build on successes without being weighed down by the past. Now, it’s moved so quickly and exponentially that they’ve barely had time to catch their collective breath — with another stretch of arena dates and a pair of co-headlining stadium shows with System of a Down on the docket.

“I’m excited to be busy,” Moreno says. “I’m the type of person who has been lucky enough to have done this for pretty much all of my adult life. We didn’t get to go out and tour ‘Ohms’ after it was released, and this is such a different time. I really love this batch of songs, so I’m eager to go play them and stay busy for the next couple of years.”","Sentiment score 0.20000000298023224 , Sentiment Magnitude 34.900001525878906","name:Chino Moreno type: 1 Salience 0.4017796516418457, name:Deftones type: 3 Salience 0.18954823911190033, name:fans type: 1 Salience 0.022875554859638214, name:band type: 3 Salience 0.013725999742746353, name:achievement type: 5 Salience 0.009729592129588127, name:bandmates type: 1 Salience 0.00783836655318737, name:act type: 4 Salience 0.005358181428164244, name:parents type: 1 Salience 0.003819864708930254, name:White Pony type: 5 Salience 0.003784406231716275, name:Advertisement type: 5 Salience 0.0004365541972219944, name:Sacramento type: 2 Salience 0.0031687093432992697, name:teens type: 1 Salience 0.0031562321819365025, name:song type: 5 Salience 0.0029672840610146523, name:break type: 4 Salience 0.0028955284506082535, name:arena type: 2 Salience 0.0028955284506082535, name:version type: 5 Salience 0.0028645668644458055, name:members type: 1 Salience 0.0027953581884503365, name:songs type: 5 Salience 0.002650432987138629, name:go-round type: 4 Salience 0.0025594073813408613, name:surge type: 4 Salience 0.0025594073813408613","Category:/Arts & Entertainment/Music & Audio/Rock Music , Category_confidence:99.0%"

But just as inevitably as the warm months wane, ambitious actors will attempt to play rock icons. Accents will be summoned, some of them mastered. Epic musicals involving witches, wicked or otherwise, will find their conclusions. Oscar winners will play Nazis. Jared Leto will continue to do what only Jared Leto does. Pathos will be mined from the tale of a wrestler. These are the things we expect from a robust fall season and the upcoming one will not disappoint. Here’s what our staff is most anticipating.

‘The Long Walk’ (Sept. 12)

In a near-future America ruled by a totalitarian regime (ah, the movies), several young men take part in a nationally televised endurance contest with one brutal rule: Stop walking and you die. Adapted from Stephen King’s novel first published under his Richard Bachman alias in 1979, “The Long Walk” is directed by “Hunger Games” veteran Francis Lawrence, who knows his way around dystopian survival stories. The march heads toward an ending only one contestant can reach, with Cooper Hoffman (“Licorice Pizza”) among the participants and Mark Hamill in villain mode as the implacable Major overseeing the ordeal. The contest unfolds in broad daylight as cameras and soldiers turn the asphalt into an arena. Adaptations of King books have been around for decades, but few promise the kind of slow, creeping dread this premise invites and the political overtones of militarized spectacle are hard to miss. Wear comfortable shoes and hydrate accordingly. — Josh Rottenberg

‘Eleanor the Great’ (Sept. 26)

The award for the most intriguing combo of Hollywood’s fall season has to be Scarlett Johansson and June Squibb. Johansson had a hit this summer with “Jurassic Park Rebirth” while the 95-year-old Squibb has repeatedly scored praise for her recent performances, including 2024’s “Thelma” in which she played a grandmother seeking revenge after being targeted in a scam. Both are winning accolades for “Eleanor the Great,” which marks Johansson’s debut behind the camera as director. Squibb stars as the lonely title character who falsely claims to be a Holocaust survivor, then privately frets as her lie snowballs into something unfixable. The film was an audience favorite at Cannes, ranking among The Times’ 10 best films at the festival. — Greg Braxton

‘One Battle After Another’ (Sept. 26)

Paul Thomas Anderson, who gave us the oil-soaked intensity of “There Will Be Blood,” the sleazy excess of “Boogie Nights” and the knotty elegance of “Phantom Thread,” is not the obvious choice to direct a big-budget Imax action-thriller, which is exactly why “One Battle After Another” feels like an event. Loosely inspired by Thomas Pynchon’s 1990 novel “Vineland,” the film transplants the book’s tangle of political grudges to a modern-day context of former activists forced back together when their long-vanished enemy resurfaces. Leonardo DiCaprio plays a drug-and-booze-addled revolutionary trying to rescue his kidnapped daughter, with Teyana Taylor, Regina Hall and Alana Haim as his comrades, Benicio del Toro as his wild-card ally Sensei Sergio and Sean Penn as their white-nationalist antagonist, Col. Steven J. Lockjaw. Anderson last adapted Pynchon with the loopy, stoner-inflected “Inherent Vice,” but here he’s working on a grander scale. Shot on 35mm VistaVision, “One Battle After Another” will be a rare chance to see Anderson bring his sly digressions, oddball humor and tonal whiplash to a canvas usually reserved for Bayhem. — Josh Rottenberg

‘Anemone’ (Oct. 3)

It’s being described by early marketing as an exploration of bonds between fathers, sons and brothers through “personal journeys and generational conflicts,” which honestly could describe 80% of all movies ever. Fortunately, though, plot is not the headline; casting is. ”Anemone” has apparently forced Daniel Day-Lewis out of the retirement he announced in 2017. And for a good reason: Day-Lewis co-wrote the film with his son, Ronan Day-Lewis, a New York-based painter who also directs. This will be the second time Day-Lewis the elder has come out of retirement — he left acting in the late ’90s, only to return after Martin Scorsese convinced him to do “Gangs of New York,” after which he won two more Oscars. (Not to put too much pressure on “Anemone.”) The film also stars Sean Bean, Samuel Bottomley, Safia Oakley-Green and Samantha Morton. — Mary McNamara

‘The Smashing Machine’ (Oct. 3)

What’s the Rock cooking? Another crafty career pivot from face to heel: specifically, from being the face of too many franchises with too few critical hits, to teaming up with Benny Safdie, one of the beloved bad boys of indie cinema. “The Smashing Machine” — Safdie’s first film since “Uncut Gems” (which he co-directed with his brother Josh) and Johnson’s most intriguing release since 2013’s underappreciated “Pain & Gain” — stars the former wrestler as MMA fighter Mark Kerr, who won multiple gold medals in the ’90s and early aughts while getting slammed by the painkiller addiction that enabled him to keep getting back in the ring. Kerr shared his story in a 2002 HBO documentary of the same name. It’ll be interesting to see how (or if) the harsh truth of combat sports gets the manic Safdie treatment. Best-case scenario: No holds will be barred. — Amy Nicholson

‘After the Hunt’ (Oct. 10)

Italian director Luca Guadagnino (“Call Me by Your Name,” “Challengers”) likes erotic stories that flirt with disaster. He tweaks the audience’s moral compass, and “After the Hunt” sounds like a dangerous spin on his risque business. The #MeToo-adjacent thriller stars Julia Roberts as a college professor who freezes when her favorite student (“The Bear’s” Ayo Edebiri) lodges an assault accusation against her favorite colleague (Andrew Garfield). Counter-accusations ensue, leaving Roberts’ character unsure whom to believe and paranoid that this blame tsunami will cause her own ethically dubious past to surface. Guadagnino has hinted that he’s interested in teasing out how different people (and generations) disagree on the definition of consent. The early buzz is that Roberts has seized onto the opportunity to deliver her richest performance in ages and it’s worth noting that Guadagnino has yet to win his first Oscar. — Amy Nicholson

‘A House of Dynamite’ (Oct. 10; on Netflix Oct. 24)

Kathryn Bigelow, the Oscar-winning director behind “The Hurt Locker” and “Zero Dark Thirty,” is an expert at turning real-world crises into procedural pulse-pounders. In “A House of Dynamite,” she trades the battlefield for the White House, tracking a team of officials scrambling to respond to an incoming-missile alert in near real time. The stacked cast includes Idris Elba, Rebecca Ferguson, Jared Harris, Greta Lee, Tracy Letts, Anthony Ramos and Jason Clarke. Shot with you-are-there immediacy by cinematographer Barry Ackroyd and edited by Fincher veteran Kirk Baxter (“The Social Network”), it’s Bigelow’s first feature in eight years, since her period crime drama “Detroit.” This time, it’s situation rooms, red phones and competing chains of command. The fuse is bureaucratic and the stakes are global. — Josh Rottenberg

‘If I Had Legs I’d Kick You’ (Oct. 10)

Rose Byrne in the movie “If I Had Legs I’d Kick You.” (Logan White / A24)

The most terrifying movie of the year, unsurprisingly, is about a mother just trying to get through a day — or maybe it’s her whole life? Rose Byrne stars as Linda, a Montauk therapist in an emotional tailspin: she’s tending to a sick daughter with a mystery illness that prevents her from eating normally, there’s a hole in her ceiling that’s gushing water, her husband is MIA and she’s desperate for counsel from her own aloof therapist (Conan O’Brien). Mary Bronstein’s sophomore feature skillfully takes a darkly funny look at the harrowing isolation and chaos of motherhood, often zooming in on Byrne’s face as she’s pushed to the brink. It’s also worth mentioning that rapper ASAP Rocky plays James, an unlikely partner-in-crime with a gnarly internet browser history whom Linda comes to know when her water disaster forces her to move into a motel. The A24 film, which counts Josh Safdie among its producers, earned raves out of this year’s Sundance and critics are already heralding Byrne’s performance as Oscar-worthy. — Yvonne Villarreal

‘Tron: Ares’ (Oct. 10)

AI continues to evolve onscreen — for every Entity threatening the end of civilization in “Dead Reckoning,” there’s a M3GAN 2.0 ready to come to our aid with an eye roll. “Tron: Ares” looks to split the difference: Mean-looking skyscraper-sized machines face off against Jared Leto. Never mind. You didn’t watch these movies for the plots anyway. Besides the welcome return of a cameoing Jeff Bridges from the 1982 Atari-era landmark, the new movie brings on Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross doing a proper industrial-rock score under their old moniker Nine Inch Nails, a soundtrack they’ve called “grittier” compared with their other stuff like “Challengers.” That’s reason enough to go, head-bobbing your way through lightcycle race sequences to the groove. A summer movie smuggled into the fall? Fine, we’ll need a few of those, especially as the awards drumbeat gets deafening. — Joshua Rothkopf

‘Good Fortune’ (Oct. 17)

Do you remember comedies? Do you remember the experience of going to a movie theater and laughing with a room full of complete strangers? Do you remember Aziz Ansari? “Parks and Recreation,” yes. But also the charming rom-com Netflix series “Master of None,” the one that Ansari starred in and co-created, often writing and directing as well. It’s been a minute. Ansari was set to make his feature film directorial debut in 2022, but production was halted and never resumed due to a complaint of inappropriate behavior lodged against Bill Murray. Now we finally have Ansari’s first feature, a comedy about a guardian angel (Keanu Reeves) swapping the lives of a struggling gig worker (Ansari) and his wealthy boss (Seth Rogen). Think of it as “Trading Places” with a dash of Wim Wenders. It could be sublime. It could be a train wreck. But it’s an original story from a multi-hyphenate who was viewed, not that long ago, as a major talent. I’m interested. — Glenn Whipp

‘It Was Just an Accident’ (Oct. 17)

A scene from the movie “It Was Just an Accident.” (Neon)

At their boldest, movies can demand a reckoning, a reconsideration. Iran’s Jafar Panahi swept into Cannes with this sad and furious political thriller, about the lingering aftermath of a torture master’s abuses, taking the Palme d’Or in an almost cosmic reversal of fortunes for a filmmaker who has often suffered in prison or under house arrest, his art forbidden. “It Was Just an Accident” has revealed more to me in thinking about it, especially about the precarity of everyday manners. Without ruining it, the closest comparison is to something like “Death and the Maiden.” When the tables are turned, is revenge itself a moral dead end? Based on an especially tough-minded piece of writing, this is a film that will get you contemplating pettiness and righteousness both. There’s no fall movie season without the Palme winner and last year’s “Anora” went all the way. — Joshua Rothkopf

‘Bugonia’ (Oct. 24)

There is still something astonishing that Greek-born filmmaker Yorgos Lanthimos has become as commercially successful and awards-friendly as he has, given that his work tends to be abstract, allegorical and at times willfully off-putting. Nothing if not unpredictable, Lanthimos now offers up a remake of the 2003 South Korean film “Save the Green Planet!” in which a pair of activists kidnap a pharmaceutical executive they believe to be a space alien, with Jesse Plemons as one of the plotters and Emma Stone as their target. Lanthimos’ work often combines dark comedy and an unexpected romantic streak with a potent political charge and his latest film looks to tap into the volatile energy of conspiracy theories and radical anti-corporate sentiments. Stone, who won an Oscar for her performance in Lanthimos’ “Poor Things,” continues to use her Hollywood star power to champion challenging filmmakers. This is their fifth film together. — Mark Olsen

‘Springsteen: Deliver Me From Nowhere’ (Oct. 24)

Jeremy Allen White in the movie “Springsteen: Deliver Me From Nowhere.” (Macall Polay / 20th Century Studios)

The cynical take would be: This is a naked attempt at the same commercial success as music-themed dramas like “A Complete Unknown” and “Bohemian Rhapsody.” But Bruce Springsteen and the raw, stripped-down recordings of his 1982 “Nebraska” album seem earnestly in opposition to such artless gamesmanship. Adapted and directed by Scott Cooper, the film stars Jeremy Allen White (perfectly suited for a post-“The Bear” step into movie stardom), along with Jeremy Strong as Springsteen’s faithful manager Jon Landau and additional supporting turns from Paul Walter Hauser, Stephen Graham, Gaby Hoffmann, Odessa Young and Marc Maron. A soulful, searching ’70s-style character study on the making of a now-classic ’80s album with some of the most exciting performers of 2025 is both slightly counterintuitive and something that makes total sense. — Mark Olsen

‘Die My Love’ (Nov. 7)

Jennifer Lawrence in the movie “Die My Love.” (Kimberly French / Mubi)

That title seems to have lost a comma since Cannes, but who cares? Director Lynne Ramsay has no patience for grammatical formalities and her latest burns with the punk ferocity of her finest film, 2002’s “Morvern Callar.” Ramsay has found a fellow traveler in Jennifer Lawrence, who, these days post-“Causeway,” is reinventing herself in a focused, fearless register. It’s impossible to watch “Die My Love” and not be hypnotized by its swampy psychodrama: the violent postpartum death throes of a marriage that has little reason to continue. Lawrence and her co-star, Robert Pattinson, play a city couple who move to Montana only half-believing in their own future together. Ramsay teases out something delicate and distracted in both of them. You’ll hear about these sex scenes. There’s more to the movie than that. — Joshua Rothkopf

‘Nuremberg’ (Nov. 7)

In November 1945, two dozen high-ranking officials of the Nazi Party were charged with crimes against peace, war crimes and crimes against humanity. At their center was Hermann Göring, Adolf Hitler’s second-in-command. Not surprisingly, Göring is a central character in the upcoming James Vanderbilt film “Nuremberg.” Based on Jack El-Hai’s 2013 book “The Nazi and the Psychiatrist,” “Nuremberg” focuses on the relationship between Göring, played by Russell Crowe, and Douglas Kelley (Rami Malek), the psychiatrist tasked with determining if Göring and the other Nuremberg defendants were capable of standing trial. Though in hindsight Göring’s conviction seems inevitable, many of the Allied leaders had initially preferred summary execution to prevent the Nazis from gaining any kind of sympathy. Bombastic, unrepentant, with a ribald sense of humor and a defense that leaned heavily into his desire to make Germany great again, Göring came out swinging. It is difficult to imagine an actor better suited to this role than Crowe, just as Malek seems a perfect fit for Kelley, who never recovered from his discovery that the Nazis “were no different from a group of intelligent executives anywhere.” — Mary McNamara

‘Predator: Badlands’ (Nov. 7)

A scene from “Predator: Badlands.” (20th Century Studios)

Director Dan Trachtenberg rejuvenated the “Predator” franchise with his 2022 prequel “Prey,” a period piece that pitted a ferocious young Comanche warrior (Amber Midthunder) against a new iteration of the iconic alien hunter while also weaving in conflict with terrestrial interlopers. I’ve been ready for Trachtenberg’s next offering from this world ever since. While “Prey” was set during Earth’s past, “Predator: Badlands” moves the action to a remote planet in the future. There are no human protagonists needed to outmaneuver a deadly alien foe this time around. “Badlands” centers a young Predator outcast (Dimitrius Schuster-Koloamatangi) who encounters an android (Elle Fanning) created by the “Alien” franchise’s Weyland-Yutani Corp. while on his quest to hunt the deadliest of beasts. The idea of a Predator and a synthetic’s odd-couple team-up was intriguing even before the visual of an alien warrior carrying half an android on his back grabbed this “Star Wars” fan’s attention. — Tracy Brown

‘Sentimental Value’ (Nov. 7)

As the follow-up to their breakthrough collaboration on “The Worst Person in the World,” Norwegian filmmaker Joachim Trier and actor Renate Reinsve return with “Sentimental Value,” which won the second-place Grand Prix award when it premiered at Cannes earlier this year. In a richly layered study of family, legacy and nothing less than the purpose of art, Reinsve plays an emotionally fragile actor whose filmmaker father (a galvanizing Stellan Skarsgård) has written a part for her. After she refuses to even consider it, feeling that the baggage between them is too fraught, he moves on to casting an American ingenue (Elle Fanning), who may not be up to the demands of the role. (Inga Ibsdotter Lilleaas as Reinsve’s sister is also something of the film’s sneaky secret weapon.) Able to switch moods and tones with a stylish, skillful ease, Trier brings out the best in all the film’s performers, mixing a knowing, bittersweet humor with deep insights. — Mark Olsen

‘Train Dreams’ (Nov. 7, on Netflix Nov. 21)

Joel Edgerton in the movie “Train Dreams.” (Netflix)

Did we dream it at Sundance? A classically proportioned drama about the building of the American West, mostly seen from the eyes of one logger, that approaches the quiet grandeur of a Terrence Malick movie? Nope, “Train Dreams” is here and there’s something about its poise and intimacy that makes it feel, finally, like Netflix has a big awards winner, provided viewers can get beyond Joel Edgerton’s bushy beard. The performance is taciturn and nonverbal; he’s got a mouthpiece in Will Patton’s folksy narration, but what Edgerton is doing is worth leaning in for, complex and fascinating. Co-written by Clint Bentley and Greg Kwedar, the team behind “Jockey” and “Sing Sing,” and adapted from Denis Johnson’s 2011 novella, this gorgeous movie could put you in mind of a less frenetic era and also, via its piney fog-shrouded exteriors, of the country that still exists beyond all our noise. — Joshua Rothkopf

‘Jay Kelly’ (Nov. 14; on Netflix Dec. 5)

An aging movie star reflects back on his life and career, contemplating what it was all for as he heads to Europe to receive a lifetime achievement award. The new “Jay Kelly” stars George Clooney but is also in some ways about George Clooney — or at least the kind of existential crisis that only someone like George Clooney could truly understand. The latest film directed by Noah Baumbach, who co-wrote the screenplay with Emily Mortimer, “Jay Kelly” may also be full of the filmmaker’s own inner ruminations following the dismissive response to 2022’s “White Noise,” his previous film, and the overwhelming success of “Barbie,” which he co-wrote with Greta Gerwig. The stacked cast of “Jay Kelly” includes Adam Sandler, Laura Dern, Billy Crudup, Riley Keough, Stacy Keach, Jim Broadbent, Mortimer and Gerwig. Baumbach’s signature serio-comic touch, in which the humor lacerates as much as the drama, should be in full effect here. — Mark Olsen

‘The Running Man’ (Nov. 14)

Seven years ago, a movie fan tweeted at director Edgar Wright to ask if he’d ever helm a remake. “The Running Man,” Wright replied — and now he’s done just that. Prescience has always been part of this action-thriller’s hold on the imagination. Stephen King dreamed up the idea of a deadly TV competition in 1982, years before “Survivor” brought the thrill of watching real-life desperation into our living rooms, and set his dystopian story in the then-distant future of 2025. Today, King’s grim satire doesn’t seem quite as far-fetched, so Wright’s challenge will be making sure his update still packs a wallop. Glen Powell has stepped into Arnold Schwarzenegger’s running shoes as a gritty, hardscrabble contestant who flees for his life, with Josh Brolin, Colman Domingo, Lee Pace, Michael Cera and Katy O’Brian rounding out the cast. Here’s hoping this long-awaited project makes it across the finish line with panache. — Amy Nicholson

‘Wicked: For Good’ (Nov. 21)

It feels like I’ve been holding space for Part 2 of Jon M. Chu’s musical extravaganza for as long as film star Cynthia Erivo stretched out that final “aaaaaaaaaaahhh” battle cry in the showstopping “Defying Gravity” number. Adapted from the long-running Broadway musical, the bifurcated epic is mostly set before “The Wizard of Oz” and explores the origins of green-skinned Elphaba (Erivo) before she became known as the Wicked Witch of the West and her complex dynamic with rival-turned-friend Glinda (Ariana Grande). The first movie, which introduced the young women as students at Shiz University who developed an unlikely friendship after being forced to bunk together, ended with Elphaba learning about the dark realities of oppression within Oz’s Emerald City and launching onto a path of resistance, quite literally, by taking flight on her getaway broomstick and fleeing the city. This second half will explore the diverging roads the two friends take as they become the adversaries we originally came to know through Dorothy and Co. It’s hard to say which will be more entertaining, the promotional tour or the actual movie. — Yvonne Villarreal","Sentiment score 0.0 , Sentiment Magnitude 69.0999984741211","name:Paul Thomas Anderson type: 1 Salience 0.02161002904176712, name:Stephen Graham type: 1 Salience 0.015391143038868904, name:Scarlett Johansson type: 1 Salience 0.014599799178540707, name:title character type: 1 Salience 0.014487764798104763, name:film type: 5 Salience 0.011884202249348164, name:Leonardo DiCaprio type: 1 Salience 0.01077814120799303, name:movies type: 5 Salience 0.008390073664486408, name:Benny Safdie type: 1 Salience 0.008164001628756523, name:Kathryn Bigelow type: 1 Salience 0.007643681485205889, name:Yorgos Lanthimos type: 1 Salience 0.00712712574750185, name:One Battle After Another type: 5 Salience 0.006454847287386656, name:Cannes type: 2 Salience 0.006328247487545013, name:musicals type: 5 Salience 0.006209428422152996, name:students type: 1 Salience 0.006096411496400833, name:Luca Guadagnino type: 1 Salience 0.005854536313563585, name:movie type: 5 Salience 0.005671647377312183, name:Linda type: 1 Salience 0.005653363652527332, name:Rose Byrne type: 1 Salience 0.005119215231388807, name:Mark Kerr type: 1 Salience 0.005082996562123299, name:films type: 5 Salience 0.0050714630633592606","Category:/Arts & Entertainment/Movies , Category_confidence:68.0%"
